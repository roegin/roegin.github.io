<span class="bold">How Games Provoke Positive Emotion</span>
</span></span><br class="calibre13"/>
游戏如何激发积极情绪
</h1><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Games make us happy because they are hard work that we choose for ourselves, and it turns out that almost nothing makes us happier than good, hard work.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We don’t normally think of games as hard work. After all, we <span class="italic">play</span> games, and we’ve been taught to think of play as the very opposite of work. But nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, as Brian Sutton-Smith, a leading psychologist of play, once said, “The opposite of play isn’t work. It’s depression.”<a id="filepos73769" href="dummy_split_068.html#filepos897319" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">6</sup><br class="calibre3"/>6</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When we’re depressed, according to the clinical definition, we suffer from two things: a <span class="italic">pessimistic sense of inadequacy</span> and a <span class="italic">despondent lack of activity</span>. If we were to reverse these two traits, we’d get something like this: <span class="italic">an optimistic sense of our own capabilities</span> and <span class="italic">an invigorating rush of activity</span>. There’s no clinical psychological term that describes this positive condition. But it’s a perfect description of the emotional state of gameplay. A game is an opportunity to focus our energy, with relentless optimism, at something we’re good at (or getting better at) and enjoy. In other words, <span class="italic">gameplay is the direct emotional opposite of depression.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When we’re playing a good game—when we’re tackling unnecessary obstacles—we are actively moving ourselves toward the positive end of the emotional spectrum. We are intensely engaged, and this puts us in precisely the right frame of mind and physical condition to generate all kinds of positive emotions and experiences. All of the neurological and physiological systems that underlie happiness—our attention systems, our reward center, our motivation systems, our emotion and memory centers—are fully activated by gameplay.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">This extreme emotional activation is the primary reason why today’s most successful computer and video games are so addictive and mood-boosting. When we’re in a concentrated state of optimistic engagement, it suddenly becomes biologically more possible for us to think positive thoughts, to make social connections, and to build personal strengths. We are actively conditioning our minds and bodies to be happier.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">If only hard work in the real world had the same effect. In our real lives, hard work is too often something we do because we <span class="italic">have</span> to do it—to make a living, to get ahead, to meet someone else’s expectations, or simply because someone else gave us a job to do. We resent that kind of work. It stresses us out. It takes time away from our friends and family. It comes with too much criticism. We’re afraid of failing. We often don’t get to see the direct impact of our efforts, so we rarely feel satisfied.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Or, worse, our real-world work isn’t hard enough. We’re bored out of our minds. We feel completely underutilized. We feel unappreciated. We are wasting our lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When we don’t choose hard work for ourselves, it’s usually not the right work, at the right time, for the right person. It’s not perfectly customized for our strengths, we’re not in control of the work flow, we don’t have a clear picture of what we’re contributing to, and we never see how it all pays off in the end. Hard work that someone else requires us to do just doesn’t activate our happiness systems in the same way. It all too often doesn’t absorb us, doesn’t make us optimistic, and doesn’t invigorate us.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What a boost to global net happiness it would be if we could positively activate the minds and bodies of hundreds of millions of people by offering them better hard work. We could offer them challenging, customizable missions and tasks, to do alone or with friends and family, whenever and wherever. We could provide them with vivid, real-time reports of the progress they’re making and a clear view of the impact they’re having on the world around them.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">That’s <span class="italic">exactly</span> what the game industry is doing today. It’s fulfilling our need for better hard work—and helping us choose for ourselves the right work at the right time. So you can forget the old aphorism “All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy.” All good gameplay <span class="italic">is</span> hard work. It’s hard work that we enjoy and choose for ourselves. And when we do hard work that we care about, we are priming our minds for happiness.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The right hard work takes different forms at different times for different people. To meet these individual needs, games have been offering us increasingly diverse kinds of work for decades now.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">There’s <span class="bold1">high-stakes work</span>, which is what many people think of first when it comes to video games. It’s fast and action oriented, and it thrills us with the possibility not only of success but also of spectacular failure. Whether we’re driving hairpin turns at top speeds in a racing video game like the <span class="italic">Gran Turismo</span> series or battling zombies in a first-person shooter game like <span class="italic">Left 4 Dead</span>, it’s the risk of crashing, burning, or having our brains sucked out that makes us feel more alive.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But there’s also <span class="bold1">busywork,</span> which is completely predictable and monotonous. Busywork generally gets a bad rap in our real lives, but when we choose it for ourselves, it actually helps us feel quite contented and productive. When we’re swapping multicolored jewels in a casual game like <span class="italic">Bejeweled</span> or harvesting virtual crops in a social game like FarmVille, we’re happy just to keep our hands and mind occupied with focused activity that produces a clear result.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">There’s <span class="bold1">mental work</span>, which revs up our cognitive faculties. It can be rapid-fire and condensed, like the thirty-second math problems in Nintendo’s <span class="italic">Brain Age</span> games. Or it can be drawn-out and complex, like the simulated ten-thousand-year conquest campaigns in the real-time strategy game <span class="italic">Age of Empires</span>. Either way, we feel a rush of accomplishment when we put our brains to good use.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And then there’s <span class="bold1">physical work</span>, which makes our hearts beat faster, our lungs pump harder, our glands sweat like crazy. If the work is hard enough, we’ll flood our brains with endorphins, the feel-good chemical. But more importantly, whether we’re throwing punches in <span class="italic">Wii Boxing</span> or jumping around to <span class="italic">Dance Dance Revolution</span>, we just enjoy the process of getting ourselves completely worn out.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">There’s discovery work, which is all about the pleasure of actively investigating unfamiliar objects and spaces. Discovery work helps us feel confident, powerful, and motivated. When we’re exploring mysterious 3D environments, like a vast city hidden in the sea in the role-playing shooter game <span class="italic">BioShock</span>, or when we’re interacting with strange characters, like the fashionable undead teenagers who populate Tokyo in the handheld battle game <span class="italic">The World Ends with You</span>, we relish the chance to be curious about anything and everything.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Increasingly in computer and video games today there’s <span class="bold1">teamwork,</span> which emphasizes collaboration, cooperation, and contributions to a larger group. When we carve out special duties for ourselves in a complex mission like the twenty-five-player team raids in <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span>, or when we’re defending our friends’ lives in a four-player cooperative game of the comic adventure <span class="italic">Castle Crashers</span>, we take great satisfaction in knowing we have a unique and important role to play in a much bigger effort.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Finally, there’s <span class="bold1">creative work.</span> When we do creative work, we get to make meaningful decisions and feel proud of something we’ve made. Creative work can take the form of designing our homes and families in the <span class="italic">Sims</span> games, or uploading video karaoke performances of ourselves to the <span class="italic">SingStar</span> network, or building and managing an online franchise in the <span class="italic">Madden NFL</span> games. For every creative effort we make, we feel more capable than when we started.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">HIGH-STAKES WORK,</span> busywork, mental work, physical work, discovery work, teamwork, and creative work—with all this hard work going on in our favorite games, I’m reminded of something the playwright Noël Coward once said: “Work is more fun than fun.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Sure, this sounds mildly absurd. Work more fun than fun? But when it comes to games, this is measurably and demonstrably true, thanks to a psychology research method known as “experience sampling.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Psychologists use the experience sampling method, or ESM, to find out how we really feel during different parts of our day. Subjects are interrupted at random intervals with a pager or by text message and asked to report two pieces of information: what they’re doing and how they feel.<a id="filepos82956" href="dummy_split_068.html#filepos897536" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">7</sup><br class="calibre3"/>7</a> One of the most common findings of ESM research is that what we think is “fun” is actually mildly depressing.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Virtually every activity that we would describe as a “relaxing” kind of fun—watching television, eating chocolate, window-shopping, or just chilling out—doesn’t make us feel better. In fact, we consistently report feeling worse afterward than when we started “having fun”: less motivated, less confident, and less engaged overall.<a id="filepos83508" href="dummy_split_068.html#filepos897928" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">8</sup><br class="calibre3"/>8</a> But how can so many of us be so wrong about what’s fun? Shouldn’t we have a better intuitive sense of what actually makes us feel better?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We certainly have a strong intuitive sense of what makes us feel bad, and negative stress and anxiety are usually at the top of the list. ESM researchers believe that when we consciously seek out relaxing fun, we’re usually trying to reverse these negative feelings. When we seek out passive entertainment and low-engagement activities, we’re using them as a counterbalance to how stimulated and overwhelmed we feel.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But by trying to have easy fun, we actually often wind up moving ourselves too far in the opposite direction. We go from stress and anxiety straight to boredom and depression. We’d be much better off avoiding easy fun and seeking out <span class="italic">hard fun</span>, or hard work that we enjoy, instead.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Hard fun is what happens when we experience positive stress, or <span class="italic">eustress</span> (a combination of the Greek <span class="italic">eu,</span> for “well-being,” and <span class="italic">stress).</span> From a physiological and a neurological standpoint, eustress is virtually identical to negative stress: we produce adrenaline, our reward circuitry is activated, and blood flow increases to the attention control centers of the brain. What’s fundamentally different is our frame of mind.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When we’re afraid of failure or danger, or when the pressure is coming from an external source, extreme neurochemical activation doesn’t make us happy. It makes us angry and combative, or it makes us want to escape and shut down emotionally. It can also trigger avoidance behaviors, like eating, smoking, or taking drugs.<a id="filepos85402" href="dummy_split_068.html#filepos898665" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">9</sup><br class="calibre3"/>9</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But during <span class="italic">eustress</span>, we aren’t experiencing fear or pessimism. We’ve generated the stressful situation on purpose, so we’re confident and optimistic. When we choose our hard work, we enjoy the stimulation and activation. It makes us want to dive in, join together, and get things done. And this optimistic invigoration is way more mood-boosting than relaxing. As long as we feel capable of meeting the challenge, we report being highly motivated, extremely interested, and positively engaged by stressful situations. And these are the key emotional states that correspond with overall well-being and life satisfaction.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Hard fun leaves us feeling measurably better than when we started. So it’s no surprise, then, that one of the activities for which ESM subjects report the highest levels of interest and positive moods both during <span class="italic">and</span> afterward is when they’re playing games—including sports, card games, board games, and computer and video games.<a id="filepos86534" href="dummy_split_068.html#filepos899027" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">10</sup><br class="calibre3"/>10</a> The research proves what gamers already know: within the limits of our own endurance, we would rather work hard than be entertained. Perhaps that’s why gamers spend less time watching television than anyone else on the planet.<a id="filepos86815" href="dummy_split_068.html#filepos899520" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">11</sup><br class="calibre3"/>11</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As Harvard professor and happiness expert Tal Ben-Shahar puts it, “We’re much happier <span class="italic">enlivening</span> time rather than killing time.”<a id="filepos87063" href="dummy_split_068.html#filepos899875" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">12</sup><br class="calibre3"/>12</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">THERE’S ONE MORE</span> important emotional benefit to hard fun: it’s called “fiero,” and it’s possibly the most primal emotional rush we can experience.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">Fiero</span> is the Italian word for “pride,” and it’s been adopted by game designers to describe an emotional high we don’t have a good word for in English.<a id="filepos87579" href="dummy_split_068.html#filepos900120" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">13</sup><br class="calibre3"/>13</a> Fiero is what we feel after we triumph over adversity. You know it when you feel it—<span class="italic">and</span> when you see it. That’s because we almost all express fiero in exactly the same way: we throw our arms over our head and yell.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The fact that virtually all humans physically express fiero in the same way is a sure sign that it’s related to some of our most primal emotions. Our brains and bodies must have evolved to experience fiero early on the human timeline—and, in fact, neuroscientists consider it part of our “caveman wiring.” Fiero, according to researchers at the Center for Interdisciplinary Brain Sciences Research at Stanford, is the emotion that first created a desire to leave the cave and conquer the world.<a id="filepos88408" href="dummy_split_068.html#filepos900388" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">14</sup><br class="calibre3"/>14</a> It’s a craving for challenges that we can overcome, battles we can win, and dangers we can vanquish.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Scientists have recently documented that fiero is one of the most powerful neurochemical highs we can experience. It involves three different structures of the reward circuitry of the brain, including the mesocorticolimbic center, which is most typically associated with reward and addiction. Fiero is a rush unlike any other rush, and the more challenging the obstacle we overcome, the more intense the fiero.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">A GOOD GAME</span> is a unique way of structuring experience and provoking positive emotion. It is an extremely powerful tool for inspiring participation and motivating hard work. And when this tool is deployed on top of a network, it can inspire and motivate tens, hundreds, thousands, or millions of people at a time.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Anything else you think you know about games, forget it for now. All the good that comes out of games—every single way that games can make us happier in our everyday lives and help us change the world—stems from their ability to organize us around a voluntary obstacle.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Understanding that this is how games really work can help us stop worrying about how people might game our systems, and inspire us to start giving them real, well-designed games to play instead. If we actively surround ourselves with people playing the same game that we are, then we can stop being so wary of “players” playing their own game. When we know what it really means to play a good game, we can stop reminding each other: <span class="italic">This isn’t a game</span>. We can start actively encouraging people instead: This <span class="italic">could</span> be a game.</span></div>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_11"></div>
