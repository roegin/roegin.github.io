<span class="bold">Bounce: A Game to Close the Generation Gap</span>
</span></span><br class="calibre13"/>
弹跳: 一个缩小代沟的游戏
</h1><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">What would it take to convince young people to call their grandparents more often? Better yet, what would it take to convince young people to call someone <span class="italic">else’</span>s grandparents while they’re at it?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Those were the twin goals of a project called Bounce<span class="italic">—</span>a telephone conversation game designed to support cross-generational social interaction.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Bounce takes just ten minutes to play. When you call the game, you’re connected live on the phone with a “senior experience agent”—someone at least twenty years older than yourself. You follow a series of computer prompts to swap stories about your past, in order to discover life experiences you have in common. For example: What is something you both have made with your own two hands? What is a useful skill that you were both taught by a parent? What is a faraway place you both have visited? Your goal: find out how many points of connection you can make with your senior experience agent before time runs out.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Bounce was the effort of a four-person team of computer scientists and artists at the University of California, myself included. We set out to design a computer game that would spark a stronger feeling of community across the generation gap.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">There is a significant need for a game like this as retirement communities, senior centers, and continuous care homes can be very socially isolating. This is partly an environmental problem: they are typically single-use spaces, without significant cross-traffic, and there’s little opportunity for the mingling of different age groups. But it’s also partly a cultural problem: major studies at Harvard and Stanford have demonstrated that a prejudice against the elderly is one of the most widespread and intractable social biases, particularly in the United States and especially among people under the age of thirty.<a id="filepos443626" href="dummy_split_076.html#filepos955106" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">7</sup><br class="calibre3"/>7</a> Young people commonly associate older age with negative traits like diminished power, status, and ability, leading them to avoid interacting with people they perceive as elderly, even their own loved ones.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Our team spent the better part of a summer brainstorming potential concepts for a game to help bridge the generation gap more gamefully, and as part of that process I personally spent quite a lot of time on the phone with two important seniors in my life: my grandfather Herb, who was ninety-two years old that summer, and my husband’s grandmother Bettie, who was eighty-seven. I was doing “user research” with them, figuring out what kind of game-play might be fun and easy to grasp quickly—particularly for older people who are not used to playing computer games—as well as to figure out the best way to get them to interact with the game technologies.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It was immensely rewarding to spend so much time on the phone with them. Phones were, of course, a familiar technology for both parties, easy for all concerned to access and use anytime. Talking on the phone was so rewarding and easy, in fact, that it eventually became obvious that giving young people a fun reason to call seniors on the phone should be the objective of our game.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But how do you build a computer game around making a phone call? We decided that we would make the game for two players at a time, since phone calls are most satisfying between two parties. The only rule? The players should be at least twenty years apart in age. Both players would need to be on the phone, of course, but since seniors are less likely to have constant access to a personal computer, we decided that only one of the two players should need to be in front of a computer. That player would log in to the game website, then call the other player.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We called the game Bounce, after the kind of exchanges we hoped to inspire: a quick, easy bouncing of life stories off each other.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The website prompts the players with collaborative interview questions: What’s a body of water you’ve both swum in? What’s a book you’ve both recommended to a friend? What’s an experience that has made both of you nervous? The challenge is to discover a single answer for each question that is true for both players. Answers could include, for example, “We’ve both swum in the Pacific Ocean” or “We’ve both been nervous going on a first date.” When you come up with a shared answer, one player types it into the game database. You have ten minutes to answer up to ten different questions total from the database of one hundred possible questions, and you can pass on any question. The game website counts down the ten minutes and reveals your score at the end.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We ran the game as an experiment for one week, based out of a senior recreation center in San Jose, California. With this kind of game, you don’t want an open invitation to play; there needs to be a level of trust that the people calling will participate with a positive attitude. So we distributed the senior center’s phone number via e-mail and social networks to trusted friends, family, and colleagues. We also gave out the phone number to attendees of an art and technology festival in nearby downtown San Jose, expecting that anyone who participated in the festival was more likely to be a positive player, and not a “griefer”—someone looking to spoil the game, rather than play it. We used a live matchmaker at the senior center to pair off the phone-in players with the seniors.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It was a bit of a risky proposition for both the seniors and the younger players. After all, talking with a stranger can be awkward, but the game provided a clear structure and set topics for conversations. The fact that both parties on the call were working toward the same goal—a high score—created an instant connection.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The players’ strategies varied. One kind of player would rush to list every place they’d been swimming, for example, while another would prompt their partner with inquiries like, “Where did you grow up? Were you near any lakes? Have you taken any trips to any oceans?” Common answers often prompted rushes of recognition, “Oh my god, wait—I do know that river! My parents took my sister and me rafting there when we were kids!” Uncommon answers just as often led to a chatty diversion from the gameplay: “You went swimming in Alaska? Did it hurt?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Our prototype was highly successful. Nearly everyone who played once came back (or called back) to play again, and the senior players reported much higher moods after playing the game. The simple fact that they were described as “senior experience agents” in the game seemed to play an important role in their enjoyment. It set a playful tone and gave them confidence that they could participate. But perhaps the most successful design element was the score, which was both a number—your total answers out of a possible ten—and a poem.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We wanted both players to leave feeling like they had not only talked to each other, but created something together. So at the end of the game, the website turned the players’ answers into a simple, free-verse poem. Players could print the poem out or e-mail it. Poems are also captured and viewable online. Here’s an example of one of the free-verse poems that two players created as their final score together: <div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">Rougemont, making wedding pictures, tango in a barn,</span>
<br class="calibre3"/><span class="italic">Bend paper clips, cinnamon buns, tongue of a cow,</span>
<br class="calibre3"/><span class="italic">In a skirt, in the Pacific, putting together a darkroom.</span></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Each phrase of this poem represents something two strangers, at least twenty years apart in age, shared in common so far in their lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Now, I’ve never met the two players who both bend paper clips when they’re nervous and have both tangoed in a barn, but I can imagine them, meeting each other for the first time on the phone and realizing how many shared events had led up to this moment in their lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In the end, the fun of the game is quite simple: the phone rings, and it’s a stranger, and just by chance you get to discover someone very different from you who has nevertheless lived a similarly fascinating life. Of course, the game can also be played with relatives and neighbors, and more than once, because it can produce thousands of unique interview sessions.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When you start to realize how many interesting life experiences you might already share with someone from a completely different generation, there’s no limit to the number of connections you can make. And a game like Bounce makes it much easier to reach out to someone whose life might benefit greatly from knowing you better.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">THE THREE GAMES</span> described in this chapter demonstrate how quickly and effectively a game can help us band together to experience a burst of communitas and participate more actively in the social commons.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Community games have important benefits to our real lives. They may lead us to new interests—public spaces or public institutions we discover we care about more than we’d thought, or activities like storytelling and art that we want to pursue with others. Even when the game ends, we may find ourselves participating more in these spaces, institutions, and activities than before.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">On the other hand, the communitas we feel may be just a short spark of social connection, nothing more. But even playing a very short game together, we are reminded of how much we share with even the strangest of strangers. We gain confidence that we can connect with others when we want to, and when we need to.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And with that confidence, there is no reason to ever feel alone in the world—virtual, real, or otherwise.</span></div>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_37"></div>
