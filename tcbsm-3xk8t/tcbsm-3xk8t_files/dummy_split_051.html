损失的焦耳
</h1><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Imagine it’s Friday afternoon, and I have an important favor to ask of you. For the good of the planet, you need to try to conserve as much energy as possible at home this weekend. Turn off your lights earlier, charge your electronics less frequently, unplug your toaster, hang your clothes on a clothesline instead of using the dryer. How hard would you try to do me that favor?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Now let’s say I told you that I had a hundred dollars riding on your ability to reduce your overall energy usage by at least 20 percent this weekend. How hard would you try to help me win?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Finally, one more scenario. This time, I’ve got a hundred dollars riding <span class="italic">against</span> your ability to reduce your overall energy usage this weekend by 20 percent. How hard would you try to prove me wrong?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I’m not able to bet on your energy usage yet—but when the Lost Joules game launches, I will be. It’s an online stock market game that lets players make wagers (in virtual currency) on each other’s real-world energy usage. Players have a strong motivation to place good bets: if they win the bet, they’ll be able to spend the virtual currency they earn inside the Lost Joules “virtual theme park,” which will house a number of FarmVille-type games. The more energy bets you win, the more powerful and rich your Lost Joules avatar will become.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The game works with smart meters, home electricity meters that are connected to the Internet. Smart meters allow you to monitor and analyze how and where your energy is being consumed—they can even calculate exactly how much each appliance in your house is costing you. Studies have shown that having this kind of feedback makes it much easier to reduce energy consumption: on average, a smart meter user will be able to decrease his or her consumption permanently by 10 percent.<a id="filepos643235" href="dummy_split_080.html#filepos978201" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">15</sup><br class="calibre3"/>15岁</a> And that’s without friends, family, and strangers cheering you on, or trying to beat your best effort. Can you imagine how much more energy could be saved if using smart meters was turned into a good game?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Lost Joules is set to find out. The application collects personal smart-meter data from players and challenges them to achieve concrete, energy-saving missions. Then it makes that data public to other players—who will place bets on your ability to achieve energy-saving missions. If they think you can do it, they’ll bet with you—and if they doubt you, they’ll invest in someone else. The players who achieve the most missions regularly will become superstars in the Lost Joules world, generating returns not only for themselves, but also for everyone who cheers them on.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">By creating a sense of urgency, presenting a clear challenge, and adding a layer of social competition, the game turns what would otherwise feel like an ordinary, mundane effort to do a bit of good into an extraordinary effort. Suddenly, turning off an appliance becomes an epic win, with multiple rewards: emotional rewards, like more fiero and better social connectivity, <span class="italic">and</span> virtual rewards, in the form of game-world currency.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s a very big, very new idea. Lost Joules is seeking to create a sustainable engagement economy around what is currently an unsustainable energy economy. To motivate people to consume less nonrenewable energy, it offers them the opportunity to consume completely renewable emotional and virtual rewards.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s also creating a new way of helping to save the world: by investing our social attention in people who are doing good. As the game’s cocreator Richard Dorsey likes to say, “Wouldn’t it be cool if every time we unplugged an appliance or flipped a switch, somebody noticed?”<a id="filepos645321" href="dummy_split_080.html#filepos978648" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">16</sup><br class="calibre3"/>16岁</a> By turning energy saving into a massively multiplayer experience, Lost Joules takes advantage of the network effect: it amplifies my private epic wins into spectacular social achievements.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Of course, many people won’t want their energy consumption to be scrutinized and wagered on by the playing public. But given the history of increasing public disclosure on the Internet—from blogs to videos to social network to real-time status updates—it’s a safe bet that the lure of being lauded in the public spotlight will attract plenty of players. And thanks to the game’s two-tier design, even people not ready to expose their own energy consumption can help drive energy-saving behavior just by making a virtual investment.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In this way, Lost Joules represents an important design innovation in the social participation game space. It’s creating two different kinds of equally important social participation tasks, for people with smart meters and people without smart meters.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">First, and most obviously, players with smart meters can tackle the social participation task of reducing their energy consumption. This is the core “do-good” mission of the game. But there’s also the SPT of lavishing our attention on each other’s good acts. People who don’t have access to smart meters yet can still play the game, by making wagers on players who do have smart meters. And this is a real contribution to the common good, since it creates social rewards for the energy savers. Everyone likes to feel valued; Lost Joules uses virtual currency to help us show just how much we value the world-changing contributions of others.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">So what’s the best-case-scenario outcome for a game like Lost Joules? Games are a major driver of technology adoption; people are often more willing to try new technologies when there’s a good game attached. And getting people to try smart-meter technology is increasingly important, as we try to become more informed, efficient consumers of energy. Smart meters have been proven remarkably effective at changing our energy consumption behaviors for the better. The more people who use them, the better.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In the bigger picture, the real potential of Lost Joules is to demonstrate how to make better use of the abundant emotional and virtual rewards that games provide to motivate change-the-world behavior. Right now, it’s easier and more fun to be a superhero in a video game than it is to help solve real global problems in everyday life. But social participation games like Lost Joules are starting to tip the balance: soon, we may find ourselves able to do both at the same time.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The three projects described in this chapter—The Extraordinaries, Groundcrew, and Lost Joules<span class="italic">—</span>are just starting to unfold. They are all highly speculative, still in development, with modest if any results so far. They are beyond leading edge. They’re <span class="italic">bleeding edge</span>: so new, there’s significant risk that they will fail.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In fact, there’s a very good chance some of them may even wind up being examples of an epic fail rather than an epic win. But, as any good gamer knows, failure can be both rewarding and empowering, if you learn from your mistakes. Testing our potential to do more than we thought possible brings us closer to achieving it someday. As the familiar saying goes, “Even if you fall flat on your face, you’re still moving forward.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Epic wins, when connected to real-world causes, help us discover an ability to contribute to the common good that we didn’t know we had. They help us upset other people’s expectations of what is possible for ordinary people to accomplish in their spare time. And they help us set goals that would have seemed ludicrous—impossible—before we had so many volunteers so well equipped to help each other, and so effectively mobilized.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In short, social participation games are turning us into superheroes in our real lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And every superhero needs superpowers.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What kind of superpowers do we need most? Collaboration superpowers—the kind that enable us to combine forces, amplify each other’s strengths, and tackle problems at a planetary scale.</span></div>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_52"></div>
