<span class="bold">Making Better Use of Gamers’ Participation Bandwidth</span>
</span></span><br class="calibre13"/>
充分利用玩家的参与带宽
</h1><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">My experience and research suggests that gamers are more likely than anyone on the planet to contribute to an online crowdsourcing project. They already have the time and the desire to tackle voluntary obstacles. They’re playing games precisely because they hunger for more and better engagement. They also have proven computer skills and an ability to learn new interactive interfaces quickly. And if they’re playing games online, they already have the necessary network access to join any online project and start participating immediately.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Given the highly social nature of today’s best games, gamers are also very likely to have a large network of friends and family they already bring from one game to the next. This is exactly the kind of social infrastructure necessary to help grow any participation base.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">On the whole, gamers already spend more time compiling collective intelligence—and making effective use of it—than anyone else. They’re the most prolific users of wikis in the world. On Wikia, for example, the most popular wiki-hosting service, gamers are by far the leading creators of content and the most active users. With more than a million articles on ten thousand distinct wikis—each wiki for a different game—they represent the lion’s share of active content across the entire Wikia network. And as Artur Bergman, vice president of engineering and operations at Wikia, has told me many times, they are by far the most organized and ambitious wiki users on the network. “The gamers are amazing,” he said this fall, after watching multiple game walk-throughs go up overnight for newly released games. “The minute the game comes out, they start making round-the-clock edits. Within twenty-four hours, they have the whole thing documented.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The minute gamers get their hands on a new game, they start compiling collective intelligence about it. It’s not something that happens after they get tired of playing—it’s an essential part of gaming. And, according to Wikia’s traffic statistics, for every single wiki contributor, thousands more players show up to make use of the data. Gamers make daily use of collective intelligence, and as a result they instinctively understand the value and possibility of big crowd projects.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In short, gamers are already our most readily engageable citizens.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We also have ample proof that gamers want to do more than just save the virtual world. Two key projects show just how much online gamers want to do real-world good: the world hunger-fighting game Free Rice and the cancer-fighting gamer initiative Folding@home on the PlayStation 3.</span></div>
