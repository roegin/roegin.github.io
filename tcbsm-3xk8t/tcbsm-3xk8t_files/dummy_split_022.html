<div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="bold">CHAPTER SIX</span></span></div><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Becoming a Part of Something Bigger Than Ourselves</span></span></div><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">I</span>n April 2009, <span class="italic">Halo 3</span> players celebrated a collective spine-tingling milestone: 10 billion kills against their virtual enemy, the Covenant. That’s roughly one and a half times the total number of every man, woman, and child on earth.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">To reach this monumental milestone, <span class="italic">Halo 3</span> players spent 565 days fighting the third and final campaign in the fictional Great War, protecting earth from an alliance of malevolent aliens seeking to destroy the human race. Together, they averaged 17.5 million Covenant kills a day, 730,000 kills per hour, 12,000 kills a minute.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Along the way, they’d assembled the largest army on earth, virtual or otherwise. More than 15 million people had fought on behalf of the science fiction game’s United Nations Space Command. That’s roughly the total number of active personnel of all twenty-five of the largest armed forces in the real world, combined.<a id="filepos242422" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos933957" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">1</sup><br class="calibre3"/>1</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Ten billion kills wasn’t an incidental achievement, stumbled onto blindly by the gaming masses. <span class="italic">Halo</span> players made a concerted effort to get there. They embraced 10 billion kills as a symbol of just how much the <span class="italic">Halo</span> community could accomplish—and they wanted it to be something bigger than anything any other game community had achieved before. So they worked hard to make every single player as good at <span class="italic">Halo</span> 3 as possible. Players shared tips and strategies with each other and organized round-the-clock “co-op,” or cooperative, campaign shifts. They called on every registered member of <span class="italic">Halo</span> online to pitch in: “This could be something big, but we will need YOU to get it done.”<a id="filepos243244" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos934372" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">2</sup><br class="calibre3"/>2</a> They treated their mission like an urgent duty. “We know we’ll be doing our part,” one game blog declared. “Will you?”<a id="filepos243417" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos934500" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">3</sup><br class="calibre3"/>3</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s no wonder London <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> reporter Sam Leith observed in his coverage of the <span class="italic">Halo 3</span> community that “a big shift has taken place, in recent years, in the way video games are played. What was once generally a solitary activity is now . . . overwhelmingly a communal one.”<a id="filepos243819" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos934961" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">4</sup><br class="calibre3"/>4</a> More and more, gamers aren’t just in it for themselves. They’re in it for each other—and for the thrill of being a part of something bigger.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When <span class="italic">Halo</span> players finally reached their goal, they flooded online forums to congratulate each other and claim their contributions. “I just did some math and with my 32,388 kills I have .00032% of the 10 billion kills,” one player wrote. “I feel like I could have contributed more . . . well, on to 100 billion then!”<a id="filepos244396" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos935309" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">5</sup><br class="calibre3"/>5</a> This reaction was typical, and the new 100 billion goal was repeated widely on <span class="italic">Halo</span> forums. Fresh off one collective achievement, <span class="italic">Halo</span> players were ready to tackle an even more monumental goal. And they were fully prepared to recruit an even bigger community to do it. As one gamer proposed: “We did that with just a few million gamers. Imagine what we could do with the full force of six billion humans!!”<a id="filepos244871" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos935722" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">6</sup><br class="calibre3"/>6</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">Halo</span>’s creators, a Seattle, Washington-based game studio called Bungie, joined in the celebration. They issued a major press release and an open letter to the <span class="italic">Halo</span> community, emphasizing the teamwork it had taken to get to 10 billion kills: “We’ve hit the Covenant where it hurts. Made them pay a price for setting foot on our soil. We’re glad we’ve got you by our side, soldier. Mighty fine work. Here’s to ten billion more.”<a id="filepos245424" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos935850" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">7</sup><br class="calibre3"/>7</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Perhaps you’re thinking to yourself right now: <span class="italic">So?</span> What’s the point? The Covenant isn’t real. It’s just a game. What have the players actually <span class="italic">done</span> that’s worth celebrating?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">On one hand, nothing. There’s no <span class="italic">value</span> to a Covenant kill, whether you score one, 10 billion, or even 100 billion of them. Value is a measure of importance and consequence. And even the most die-hard <span class="italic">Halo</span> fan knows that there’s no real importance or consequence to saving the human race from a fictional alien invasion. There’s no actual danger being averted. There are no real lives being saved.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But on the other hand, just because the kills don’t have value doesn’t mean they don’t have <span class="italic">meaning</span>.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Meaning is the feeling that we’re a part of something bigger than ourselves. It’s the belief that our actions matter beyond our own individual lives. When something is meaningful, it has significance and worth not just to ourselves, or even to our closest friends and family, but to a much larger group: to a community, an organization, or even the entire human species.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Meaning is something we’re all looking for more of: more ways to make a difference in the bigger picture, more chances to leave a lasting mark on the world, more moments of awe and wonder at the scale of the projects and communities we’re a part of.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">How do we get more meaning in our lives? It’s actually quite simple. Philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual leaders agree: the single best way to add meaning to our lives is to <span class="italic">connect our daily actions to something bigger than ourselves</span>—and the bigger, the better. As Martin Seligman says, “The self is a very poor site for meaning.” We can’t <span class="italic">matter</span> outside of a large-scale social context. “The larger the entity you can attach yourself to,” Seligman advises, “the more meaning you can derive.”<a id="filepos247669" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos935978" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">8</sup><br class="calibre3"/>8</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And that’s exactly the point of working together in a game like <span class="italic">Halo 3</span>. It’s not that the Covenant kills have value. It’s that pursuing a massive goal alongside millions of other people feels good. It feels meaningful. When players dedicate themselves to a goal like 10 billion Covenant kills, they’re attaching themselves to a cause, and they’re making a significant contribution to it. As the popular gamer site Joystiq reported on the day <span class="italic">Halo</span> players celebrated their 10 billionth kill: “Now we know for sure.... Every kill you get in <span class="italic">Halo 3</span>’s campaign actually <span class="italic">means</span> something.”<a id="filepos248393" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos936140" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">9</sup><br class="calibre3"/>9</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">To experience <span class="italic">real</span> meaning, we don’t have to contribute something of <span class="italic">real</span> value. We just have to be given the opportunity to contribute at all. We need a way to connect with others who care about the same massively scaled goal we do, no matter how arbitrary the goal. And we need a chance to reflect on the truly epic scale of what we’re doing together.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Which gives us our sixth fix for our broken reality:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">FIX #6: EPIC SCALE</span></span></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Compared with games, reality is trivial. Games make us a part of something bigger and give epic meaning to our actions.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">“Epic” is the key word here. Blockbuster video games like <span class="italic">Halo</span>—the kind of games that have a production budget of thirty, forty or even fifty million dollars—aren’t just “something bigger.” They’re big enough to be <span class="italic">epic</span>.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">Epic</span> is one of the most important concepts in gamer culture today. It’s how players describe their most memorable, gratifying game experiences. As one game critic writes, “<span class="italic">Halo 3</span> is epic. It empowers you the way no other game can. It doesn’t have moments, but events. Experiences that tickle the soul, sending shivers down the spine<span class="italic">.</span>”<a id="filepos250089" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos936559" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">10</sup><br class="calibre3"/>10</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">A good working definition for “epic” is something that far surpasses the ordinary, especially in size, scale, and intensity. Something epic is of <span class="italic">heroic proportions</span>. Blockbuster video games do epic scale better than any other medium of our time, and they’re epic in three key ways:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">They create <span class="italic">epic contexts for action</span>: collective stories that help us connect our individual gameplay to a much bigger mission.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"> <br class="calibre3"/></span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">They immerse us in <span class="italic">epic environments</span>: vast, interactive spaces that provoke feelings of curiosity and wonder.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><span class="calibre10"> <br class="calibre3"/></span></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">And they engage us in <span class="italic">epic projects</span>: cooperative efforts carried out by players on massive scales, over months or even years.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">There’s a reason why gamers love epic games. It’s not just that bigger is better. It’s that bigger is more awe-inspiring.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">Awe</span> is a unique emotion. According to many positive psychologists, it’s the single most overwhelming and gratifying positive emotion we can feel. In fact, neuropsychologist Paul Pearsall calls awe “the orgasm of positive emotions.”<a id="filepos251712" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos936846" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">11</sup><br class="calibre3"/>11</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Awe is what we feel when we recognize that we’re in the presence of something bigger than ourselves. It’s closely linked with feelings of spirituality, love, and gratitude—and more importantly, a desire to serve.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In <span class="italic">Born to Be Good</span>, Dacher Keltner explains, “The experience of awe is about finding your place in the larger scheme of things. It is about quieting the press of self-interest. It is about folding into social collectives. It is about feeling reverential toward participating in some expansive process that unites us all and that ennobles our life’s endeavors.”<a id="filepos252464" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos937089" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">12</sup><br class="calibre3"/>12</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In other words, awe doesn’t just <span class="italic">feel</span> good; it inspires us to <span class="italic">do</span> good.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Without a doubt, it’s awe that a <span class="italic">Halo 3</span> player is feeling when he says that the game sends “shivers down the spine.” Spine tingling is one of the classic physiological symptoms of awe—along with chills, goose bumps, and that choked-up feeling in the throat.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Our ability to feel awe in the form of chills, goose bumps, or choking up serves as a kind of emotional radar for detecting meaningful activity. Whenever we feel awe, we know we’ve found a potential source of meaning. We’ve discovered a real opportunity to be of service, to band together, to contribute to a larger cause.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In short, awe is a call to collective action.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">So it’s no accident that <span class="italic">Halo</span> players are so inclined toward collective efforts. It’s the direct result of the game’s epic, and awe-inspiring, aesthetic. Today’s best game designers are experts at giving individuals the chance to be a part of something bigger—and no one is better at it than the creators of <span class="italic">Halo</span>. Everything about the <span class="italic">Halo</span> games—from the plot and the sound track to the marketing and the way the community is organized online—is intentionally crafted to make players feel that their gameplay really means something. And the one simple trick used over and over again is this: always connect the individual to something bigger.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Let’s take a closer look at exactly how <span class="italic">Halo</span> does it.</span></div>
