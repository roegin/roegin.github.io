<span class="bold">The Evolution of Games as a Collaboration Platform</span>
</span></span><br class="calibre13"/>
游戏作为协作平台的演变
</h1><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Since ancient times, gaming with others has always required making a concerted effort to collaborate. This is true of dice games, card games, chess, sports, and any other kind of multiplayer game you can think of.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Every multiplayer game begins with a cooperative agreement. Gamers agree to play by the same rules and to value the same goal. This establishes a <span class="bold1">common ground</span> for working together.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Games also require us to coordinate attention and participation resources. Gamers must show up at the same time, in the same mind-set, to play together. They actively focus their attention on the game, and they agree to ignore everything else for as long as they’re playing. They practice <span class="bold1">shared concentration</span> and <span class="bold1">synchronized engagement.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Gamers depend on each other to play as hard as they can, because it’s no fun winning without a challenge. In this way, gamers foster <span class="bold1">mutual regard</span><span class="italic">.</span> Out of respect for each other, they put in their best effort, and they fully expect to encounter a worthy partner or adversary.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Gamers rely on each other at all times to keep the game going, even if it’s not working out in their favor. Whenever they see a game through to completion, gamers are honing their ability to honor a <span class="bold1">collective commitment.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Perhaps most importantly, gamers actively work together to make believe that the game truly matters. They conspire to give the game real meaning, to help each other get emotionally caught up in the act of playing, and to reap the positive rewards of playing a good game. Whether they win or lose, they’re creating <span class="bold1">reciprocal rewards.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In short, good games don’t just happen. Gamers work to make them happen. Any time you play a game with someone else, unless you’re just trying to spoil the experience, you are actively engaged in highly coordinated, <span class="italic">prosocial</span> behavior. No one forces gamers to play by the rules, to concentrate deeply, to try their best, to stay in the game, or to act as if they care about the outcome. They do it voluntarily, for the mutual benefit of everyone playing, because it makes a better game.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">This is true even in games that involve fierce competition. Consider the origins of the English word “compete”: it comes from the Latin verb <span class="italic">competere</span>, which means “to come together, to strive together” (from <span class="italic">com-</span>, or “with,” and <span class="italic">-petere</span>, meaning “to strive, seek”). To compete <span class="italic">against</span> someone still requires coming together <span class="italic">with them</span>: to strive toward the same goal, to push each other to do better, and to participate wholeheartedly in seeing the competition through to completion.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">That’s why today competitive online gamers—even after they’ve been virtually beaten, bloodied, or blasted by each other—thank each other afterward by typing or saying “GG,” short for “good game.” It’s a grateful acknowledgment that, regardless of who wins or loses, everyone in a good game has tried hard, played fair, and worked together. That’s the fundamental act of collaboration at the heart of every good multiplayer game: the active and concerted creation of a positive experience. Gamers don’t just play a good game. They <span class="italic">make</span> a good game.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In fact, the ability to make a good game together has recently been identified by researchers as a distinctive human capability—indeed, perhaps <span class="italic">the</span> distinctive human capability. The developmental psychologist Michael Tomasello, author of <span class="italic">Why We Cooperate</span> and codirector of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, has spent his career devising experiments to investigate what kinds of behaviors and skills set humans apart from other species. His research suggests that the ability to play complex games together, and to help others learn the rules of a game, represents the essence of what makes us human—something he calls “shared intentionality.”<a id="filepos660620" href="dummy_split_081.html#filepos979783" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">2</sup><br class="calibre3"/>2</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Shared intentionality, according to Tomasello, is defined as “the ability to participate with others in collaborative activities with shared goals and intentions.” <a id="filepos660897" href="dummy_split_081.html#filepos979979" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">3</sup><br class="calibre3"/>3</a> When we have shared intentionality, we actively identify as part of a group, we deliberately and explicitly agree on a goal, and we can understand what others expect us to do in order to work toward the goal. Tomasello’s research reveals that, in comparison with humans, other intelligent social species like chimpanzees simply do not appear to have shared intentionality. They don’t have the natural instinct and ability to focus their attention on the same object, coordinate group activity, assess and reinforce each other’s commitment to the activity, and work toward a common goal.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Without the distinctly human capacity for shared intentionality, we couldn’t collaborate; we would have no idea how to build common ground, set group goals, or take collective action. According to Tomasello, children are capable of shared intentionality at a very early age. His evidence: their natural ability to play a game with others, and their ability to recognize when someone isn’t playing the game in a way that favors the group.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In one of Tomasello’s key experiments at the Max Planck Institute, children between the ages of two and three are taught to play a new game together—either a dice game for the two-year-olds or a building-block game for the three-year-olds. <a id="filepos662333" href="dummy_split_081.html#filepos980230" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">4</sup><br class="calibre3"/>4</a> Then a puppet controlled by another experimenter joins the game and plays it incorrectly, according to its own made-up rules. Tomasello and his colleagues report that children immediately and universally object to this bad game behavior and attempt to correct the puppet, in order to keep the game successfully going—even though they haven’t been instructed to do so. This behavior was more “vociferous” among the three-year-olds, according to the published findings, but clearly widespread among the two-year-olds as well. We are able to make a good game together—and we are inclined to do so from nearly the moment we are born. We have a hardwired desire and capacity to cooperate and coordinate our actions with others, to effectively immerse ourselves in groups, and to actively cocreate positive shared experiences.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And yet this desire can be diminished and our natural abilities weakened or eventually lost, Michael Tomasello argues, if we grow up in a culture without sufficient opportunities to nurture and develop it.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">If we are to achieve our human potential to be extraordinary collaborators, he urges, we must immerse ourselves in high-collaboration environments—and we must encourage young people to spend as much time as possible participating in groups that encourage and value cooperation. Fortunately, as online and multiplayer games become more and more central to global popular culture, we have all the encouragement we need to practice our natural collaboration abilities. Multiplayer and online games strengthen our capacity to build and exercise shared intentionality.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Every time we agree to play a game together, we are practicing one of the talents that makes us fundamentally human.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">THIS IS NOT</span> to suggest that online gaming today is one giant cooperative utopia. The kill-or-be-killed adrenaline rush of player vs. player environments can easily overshadow the very real undertones of cooperation and collaboration that otherwise exist. Graphic violent content, combined with the anonymity of the Internet, doesn’t necessarily inspire camaraderie among strangers. That’s why toxic social interactions can and do erupt in hard-core, or especially competitive, communities, as normally playful gamer behaviors like taunting and trash-talking get out of hand.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Even in friendlier matches, many gamers care very deeply about whether or not they win. They’re seeking that fiero moment and wind up feeling disappointed or angry if they lose. In that case, even the fundamentally collaborative spirit of making a good game together can’t completely alleviate the sting of loss.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Yet despite all these potentially mitigating factors, gamer culture is moving insistently in the direction of more shared intentionality, not less. For the past few years, cooperative, or <span class="italic">co-op</span>, play and <span class="italic">collaborative creation</span> systems have consistently remained the most celebrated trends in gaming.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In <span class="bold1">co-op mode,</span> gamers work together to defeat an AI opponent and to increase each other’s scores, rather than competing against each other. Classic examples of co-op play include <span class="italic">Rock Band</span> and the first-person shooter series <span class="italic">Left 4 Dead</span>. Although there are competitive elements to both games, the primary focus is on working together to achieve a goal.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Even in game series that have previously specialized in single-player and player vs. player experiences, co-op mode is becoming more and more central. The counterterrorist-themed <span class="italic">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</span>, the fastest-selling entertainment product in world history—it grossed $550 million in five days, more than any book, movie, album, or other game ever produced—has been particularly praised for its new Spec Ops mode, a series of twenty-three extremely challenging missions designed to be played cooperatively with a friend.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The industry’s increased attention to co-op mode represents an extremely significant development in gaming culture. It’s a recognition that many gamers are happier tackling challenges together than taking on each other as opponents. Co-op games deliver all the emotional rewards of a good game, while helping gamers avoid activating the negative emotions that can come with highly competitive play: feelings of aggression, anger, disappointment, or humiliation. That’s why it’s not surprising that surveys and polls repeatedly have shown that, on average, three out of four gamers prefer co-op mode to competitive multiplayer.<a id="filepos667402" href="dummy_split_081.html#filepos980571" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">5</sup><br class="calibre3"/>5</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Game developers aren’t just designing more co-op play; they’re also creating new <span class="bold1">real-time coordination tools</span> to help us find the right people at the right time to cooperate with. The Xbox Live platform, for example, enables players to monitor who else in their social network is logged in to the game console, what they’re playing at the moment, and what other games they have in their library to play with you. You can browse your friends’ records of game achievements and compare them against your own—which helps you figure out who would make a good partner on a given mission or in a particular game. You can also receive alerts on your mobile phone or your computer whenever, for example, a friend logs in to Xbox Live to play a game or he or she unlocks an achievement. As a result, Xbox gamers have an unusually high level of awareness of what potential coplayers are doing at any given time, what they’re good at, and what resources they have to play with. The ambient awareness dramatically amplifies their ability to coordinate good gameplay.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Meanwhile, in <span class="bold1">collaborative creation systems</span>, gamers get to create their own digital content, in order to build up their favorite worlds for the benefit of other players. Take <span class="italic">Little Big Planet</span> for example—it’s one of the most acclaimed collaborative creation games released in recent years. In the traditional “play mode” of the game, you cooperate with up to three friends to traverse the game world and collect game objects together—stickers, gadgets, toys, and craft and building materials. At any time, you can switch from play mode to “create mode”; here you find yourself in a collaborative building environment called Popit, in which you can design your own original action-adventure landscapes out of the objects and materials you’ve already collected. It’s a level-building system that you might call the game-design equivalent of Google Docs. Multiple people can view and edit the level at the same time; it can then be shared, or “published,” to the rest of the world.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Within a year, more than 1.3 million player-created levels had been published by <span class="italic">LBP</span> players. Compare this epic number with the relatively small number of official <span class="italic">LBP</span> levels: forty-five. Collectively, the <span class="italic">LBP</span> player base has dramatically expanded the playable <span class="italic">LBP</span> universe by a factor of nearly thirty thousand. As one games journalist observed on the one-year anniversary of the game’s release, “[It] would likely take multiple lifetimes to play through every single creation out there.”<a id="filepos670204" href="dummy_split_081.html#filepos980912" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">6</sup><br class="calibre3"/>6</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The ability to create your own levels and share them with other players was the signature selling feature of <span class="italic">Little Big Planet</span>. But increasingly, successful game series are offering similar systems as a “value-add,” in order to give players more explicit collaboration opportunities. For example, <span class="italic">Halo 3</span> introduced the new Forge system, which invites players to design their own original multiplayer <span class="italic">Halo</span> levels, or “maps,” by customizing what weapons, vehicles, and tools are distributed where. Like LBP’s Popit system, players can upload and share their custom configurations with each other, and using the Forge tools, it’s possible to create literally billions and billions of different maps. So instead of being restricted to a finite number of play environments, the <span class="italic">Halo</span> community can keep the game going, increasing and diversifying the playing challenges for each other indefinitely.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s not easy to design a good world, of course. So alongside the growing collection of collaborative creation systems, there are also a growing number of player-created guides to creating better levels and maps. Take, for example, the Forge Hub, a resource for becoming a better <span class="italic">Halo 3</span> world builder. It offers extensive tutorials in various mapmaking skills and curates player-created maps into different collections. It’s a natural extension of the knowledge sharing and collective intelligence culture already taking place on the more than ten thousand player-created game wikis. Gamers aren’t just making each other better players; they’re making each other better designers.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But perhaps the most unusual innovation in gamer collaboration culture in recent years is the notion of the <span class="bold1">massively single-player online game.</span> It’s a twist on the traditional massively multiplayer online concept—and, on first impression, it sounds like an impossible paradox. How can you have a “massively” single-player experience when by definition a single-player experience occurs alone?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The inventor of the term is Will Wright, the famed creator of <span class="italic">SimCity</span> and <span class="italic">The Sims</span> games. He coined it to describe his 2008 game <span class="italic">Spore</span>, a simulation of the universe that invites players to design a galaxy from scratch, starting with a single-cell creature and evolving it up into a land-dwelling species, then into tribes, complex civilizations, and ultimately a space-faring, planet-designing megacivilization.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">All <span class="italic">Spore</span> gameplay is single-player: an individual controls all the simulation details and conducts all the fighting, mating, crafting, and exploring alone. There are no other players in the simulated ecosystem; everything in the world is controlled by artificial intelligence. So what makes it <span class="italic">massively</span> single-player, as opposed to simply single-player? A very large percentage of the content in each player’s game world—the other creatures you encounter and the civilizations you visit—has been created by other players who have contributed them to the online Sporepedia, a massive database of ecosystem content. When you play <span class="italic">Spore</span> online, your computer checks the Sporepedia for new and interesting content and downloads it into your personal Spore ecosystem, making your game world a mix of your own original contributions and those of many, many others.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Although there is no direct interaction with other players, you indirectly collaborate with each other to invent the <span class="italic">Spore</span> universe. You can randomly populate your world with other players’ creations, or you can handpick creations you like from the Sporepedia. You can even subscribe to a Sporecast, which will automatically update your game world with new content created by your friends or favorite players.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Players use Sporepedia and the <span class="italic">Spore</span> forums and wikis to learn what other players are making and to improve their own creation techniques. They don’t collaborate in the real-time gameplay, but ultimately the world that players help design is a collaborative product: a unique combination of each player’s own creations mingled with content from hundreds, thousands, or even millions of other players, depending on how far they get in the game and how much content they choose to download.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">A massively single-player game like <span class="italic">Spore</span> suggests that epic contexts combined with collaborative production tools and sophisticated content-sharing platforms can create opportunities for what we might call <span class="bold1">lightweight, asynchronous collaboration</span>. It’s less immediately interactive, but it can still produce extreme-scale results. So far, <span class="italic">Spore</span> players from more than thirty countries have created and shared more than 144 million ecosystem objects, from creatures to buildings to space-faring vehicles.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">OF COURSE ,</span> collaboration skills are on the rise around the world among nongamers as well. From widespread basic Internet literacy and mobile technology smarts to rapidly expanding Web 2.0 and crowdsourcing know-how, people everywhere are becoming increasingly connected and improving their ability to cooperate, coordinate, and create together in many important ways. In this sense, gamers are just part of a larger social and technological trend toward more collaboration.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But gamers are having so much <span class="italic">fun</span> developing their collaboration skills, they’re collectively spending more time than anyone else in the world honing and applying them. Every day and night, hundreds of millions of strangers from all over the world come together to prototype and playtest new ways of collaborating. The more they play together, and the closer they get to ten thousand hours of practice collaborating, the more justifiably optimistic they become about what they can accomplish together—and so they demand even more extreme collaboration challenges. And because gamers have developed such a growing appetite for collaboration at extreme scales, they’ve pushed the gaming industry to develop software and platforms that increasingly emphasize collaboration as a central gameplay mechanism.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As a result of the industry’s relentless focus on innovating new ways to cooperate, coordinate, and cocreate, many online gamers are developing a new set of <span class="italic">collaboration superpowers</span> that transcend what they—and nongamers—are capable of doing in real-world, or nongame, environments. These gamers are on the front lines of testing and improving the ways we organize ourselves, amplify each other’s individual abilities, and contribute to the common good.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Which gives us another fix for reality: <div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">FIX # 13: TEN THOUSAND HOURS COLLABORATING</span></span></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Compared with games, reality is disorganized and divided. Games help us make a more concerted effort—and over time, they give us collaboration superpowers.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What do I mean by collaboration <span class="italic">superpowers</span>?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">A superpower is not just a new skill. It’s a skill that so far surpasses any previously demonstrated skill, and it effectively changes our notion of what is humanly possible.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The term “superpower” suggests that something is happening outside the traditional model of learning and skill acquisition. Typically, we think of practice as moving us from a zero-skill level to basic competency and then, if we keep practicing, to proficiency and ultimately to mastery. But mastery presumes that there is some finite end to the skill level it is possible to achieve. So why stop at mastery? The term “superpower” reminds us that we are on the threshold of a new kind of capability, one that has not yet been mastered by anyone, anywhere. There’s no telling yet how far these new capabilities will develop.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What, exactly, do these new capabilities look like?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In my research at the Institute for the Future, I’ve developed a model of how someone with collaboration superpowers works. It involves three key new skills and abilities.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Extraordinary collaborators are extremely extroverted or outgoing in a network environment—even if they’re introverted or shy in face-to-face settings. They have what I call a <span class="bold1">high ping quotient</span>, or high PQ. (In tech speak, a “ping” is a computer network tool that sends a message from one computer to another in order to check whether it is reachable and active. If it is, it will send back the message “pong,” thus establishing an active line of communication.) Extraordinary collaborators have no qualms about <span class="italic">pinging</span>—or reaching out via electronic means—to others to ask for their participation. They’re also highly likely to pong back when other people ping them. That’s what makes a high ping quotient a form of social capital.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Of course, it helps to have a good sensibility about who to ping when. (Otherwise, you become a participation spammer.) That’s why extraordinary collaborators develop a kind of internal <span class="bold1">collaboration radar</span>, or sixth sense, about who would make the best collaborators on a particular task or mission. This sixth sense comes from building up a very strong social network and maintaining a kind of peripheral awareness of what other people are doing, where they are, and what they’re getting good at. And it’s not just an internal system: collaboration radar is often augmented with “ambient information systems,” like Twitter lists, the Xbox 360 friends dashboard, or the Groundcrew volunteer availability system. The stronger your collaboration radar, the faster you can leverage individuals’ abilities toward the right effort.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Finally, the most extraordinary collaborators in the world exercise a superpower I call <span class="bold1">emergensight</span>. It’s the ability to thrive in a chaotic collaborative environment. The bigger and more distributed a collaborative effort gets, the more likely it is to become both chaotic and hard to predict. We know this from physics and systems theory: bigger isn’t more; it’s different. That’s the principle of <span class="italic">emergence</span>. It’s impossible to predict what will happen at scale until you get there, and it’s likely to be vastly more complex than you expected. Of course, with increased complexity comes increased potential for chaos.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Extraordinary collaborators are adept and comfortable working within complex, chaotic systems. They don’t mind messiness or uncertainty. They immerse themselves in the flow of the work and keep a high-level perspective rather than getting lost in the weeds. They have the information stamina to filter large amounts of noise and remain focused on signals that are meaningful to their work. And they practice possibility scanning: always remaining open and alert to unplanned opportunities and surprising insights—especially at bigger scales. They are willing to bypass or throw out old goals if a more achievable or a more epic goal presents itself. And they are constantly zooming out to construct a much bigger picture: finding ways to extend collaborative efforts to new communities, over longer time cycles and toward more epic goals.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">These three ways of working make up what I consider to be the most important attributes of an extraordinary collaborator. Together, these traits enable us to discover and contribute our individual strengths and expertise to a large, open-ended effort.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">These collaboration superpowers aren’t widely distributed yet. They’re concentrated among gamers who, for the past decade, have consistently played the games that have been on the leading edge of co-op, collective intelligence, and collaborative production. But, obviously, these collaboration superpowers would be extremely useful outside of game settings. They could be applied to tremendous effect across many different real-world domains: data collection and analysis, social action, risk assessment, scientific research, innovation of new products and services, and government, to name just a few.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Indeed, if these collaboration superpowers become sufficiently widespread, it’s easy to imagine a future in which there is significantly more collective effort harnessed toward solving extreme-scale problems, like ending poverty, preventing catastrophic climate change, reducing terrorist activity, and improving global health. But before we can use these superpowers to solve real-world problems, we need to distribute them more broadly throughout society. Collaboration is most effective when there are diverse actors. We need to put these collaboration superpowers in the hands of as many people as possible—especially young people, who represent the next generation of social actors and problem solvers.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">That’s why, in my commercial game-design work, I am always drawn to projects that can serve as learning environments for collaboration superpowers. I think of these projects as global collaboration laboratories, or <span class="bold1">collaboratories</span> : online spaces for young people from around the world to come together and test and develop their ability to cooperate, coordinate, and cocreate at epic scales.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The best way to understand the modus operandi of extraordinary collaborators is in the context of a real working collaboratory. So let’s take a look at The Lost Ring, an alternate reality game that I designed for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.</span></div>
