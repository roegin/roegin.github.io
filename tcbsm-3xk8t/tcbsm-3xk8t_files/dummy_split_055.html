<div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="bold">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</span></span></div><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Saving the Real World Together</span></span></div><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">W</span>e are living in a geological era that scientists dub the “anthropocene epoch,” from the Greek <span class="italic">anthropo</span>-, for “human,” and <span class="italic">-cene,</span> for “new” or “recent.” It’s the age of human impact on the earth.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Our impact is measurable in myriad ways: increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, deforestation and continental erosion, a rising sea level. We may not have set out to remake the planet in any of these ways—but we have nonetheless. And now we must learn better ways of remaking it, this time with intention, discipline, and purpose.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As Steward Brand, author of <span class="italic">Whole Earth Discipline</span>, puts it, “Humanity is now stuck with a planet stewardship role.... We are as gods and <span class="italic">have</span> to get good at it.”<a id="filepos723520" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos983323" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">1</sup><br class="calibre3"/>1</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Brand is perhaps best known as the founder of the <span class="italic">Whole Earth Catalog</span>, a countercultural catalog of “tools and ideas to shape the environment” published from 1968 to 1972. (When he launched that catalog, he wrote, “We are as gods and might as well get good at it.”)<a id="filepos723905" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos983555" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">2</sup><br class="calibre3"/>2</a> In 1996 he cofounded the Long Now Foundation, a San Francisco-based foundation dedicated to long-term thinking and responsibility—for the earth, and for the survival of the human species—over the next ten thousand years and beyond. If we want to stay on this planet for anywhere near that long, Brand says, we have to become better at strategically affecting our ecosystem. “We are forced to learn planet craft—in both senses of the word. Craft as skill and craft as cunning.” We not only have to master the ability to change how our ecosystem works, we also have to figure out the right ways to change it. And that won’t be easy.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">“The forces in play in the Earth system are astronomically massive and unimaginably complex,” Brand writes.<a id="filepos724756" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos983948" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">3</sup><br class="calibre3"/>3</a> “We’re facing multidecade, multigeneration problems and solutions. Accomplishing what is needed will take diligence and patience—a sustained <span class="italic">bearing down</span>, over human lifetimes, to bridge the long lag times and lead times in climate, biological, and social dynamics.”<a id="filepos725084" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos984113" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">4</sup><br class="calibre3"/>4</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Fortunately for all of us, gamers actually have a head start on this mission.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Gamers have been mastering the art of planet craft for years. There’s actually a genre of computer games known as “god games”—world- and population-management simulations that give a single player the ability to shape the course of events on earth in dramatic ways, over lifetimes or longer.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As we’ve seen, Will Wright’s <span class="italic">The Sims</span> gives players godlike powers over the daily lives of individual people. Sid Meier’s <span class="italic">Civilization</span> challenges players to guide a civilization (such as the Aztecs, the Romans, the Americans, the Zulus) from the start of the Bronze Age, six thousand years ago, through the Space Age, or AD 2100. And Peter Molyneux’s <span class="italic">Black &amp; White</span> invites players to govern the entire biome of a remote island, inspiring either joyful worship or terrified obedience in the island’s tribal population by performing a combination of benevolent and evil divine ecological interventions.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What all of these god games have in common is that they encourage players to practice the three skills that are critical for real planet craft: taking a long view, ecosystems thinking, and pilot experimentation.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">Taking a long view</span> means working at scales far larger than we would ordinarily encounter in our day-to-day lives. Players of god games have to consider their moment-by-moment actions in the context of a very long future: an entire simulated human life, a single civilization’s rise and fall, or even the entire course of human history.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">Ecosystems thinking</span> is a way of looking at the world as a complex web of interconnected, interdependent parts. A good ecosystems thinker will study and learn how to anticipate the ways in which changes to one part of an ecosystem will impact other parts—often in surprising and far-reaching ways.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">Pilot experimentation</span> is the process of designing and running many small tests of different strategies and solutions in order to discover the best course of action to take. When you’ve successfully tested a strategy, you can scale up your efforts to make a bigger impact. Since god gamers want to maximize their success, they don’t just come up with one plan and stick to it. Instead, they carefully feel their way around the system, poking and prodding until they find the strategies that seem to reliably maximize success.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Taken together, these three ways of thinking and acting are exactly the kinds of effort Brand recommends in <span class="italic">Whole Earth Discipline</span>. Instead of seizing the day, he says, “Seize the century.”<a id="filepos728186" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos984247" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">5</sup><br class="calibre3"/>5</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">He advises, “Participation has to be subtle and tentative, and then cumulating in the right direction. If we make the right moves at the right time, all may yet be well.”<a id="filepos728469" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos984375" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">6</sup><br class="calibre3"/>6</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">OF COURSE,</span> we can’t actually use existing commercial computer games as test environments to solve the real problems we face. They radically simplify the forces at play in the complex ecosystems we live in. But as we try to develop systems for engaging massively many people in world-changing efforts, we can take an important cue from the most successful god games. Specifically, we can learn from their ability to change the way players think about the world, and their own powers within it.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Take, for example, the most epic god game yet designed—the universe simulation <span class="italic">Spore</span>, developed by Will Wright and produced by Maxis Software. Of all the god games to date, <span class="italic">Spore</span> is the most explicitly linked to the notion of planet craft—and the most intentionally focused on getting players to think of themselves as capable of changing the real world.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In <span class="italic">Spore</span>, players control the development of a unique species through five stages of evolution: from single-cell origins (stage one) into social, land-dwelling creatures (stage two), who form tribes (stage three), build technologically sophisticated civilizations (stage four), and ultimately venture off into intergalactic space exploration (stage five). Each stage zooms out to give the player control over a more complex system. Players advance from manipulating cellular DNA to increasing their creature’s intelligent behaviors; from organizing a division of labor in their tribe to growing a global economy; from advancing national interests through trade, military action, or spiritual outreach to colonizing other planets and transforming them into inhabitable ecosystems. They can spend as much time as they want in any stage, piloting different strategies for improving their species and transforming the environment.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The game is fun and rewarding to play, but it’s meant to accomplish more than just relieving boredom or making us happy. As Wright has said on numerous occasions, the game is meant to spark a sense of <span class="italic">creative capability</span> among players, and to inspire them to adopt the kind of long-term, planetary outlook that can save the real world.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Consider this exchange, which occurred shortly after the 2008 release of <span class="italic">Spore</span>, when the popular science magazine <span class="italic">Seed</span> hosted a public salon between Wright and Jill Tarter, a noted astrobiologist. The topic of the salon: how games like <span class="italic">Spore</span> are preparing young people to take a more active role in reimagining the real world.</span></div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">TARTER:</span> I keep thinking about the generation that’s getting exposed to all this wonderful, rich opportunity of game playing as education, and that they expect to be able to manipulate the real world the way they do the game world. How do we bridge that? How do we turn them into socially functioning members of humanity on one planet? [. . .]</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I’m eager to understand how learning to be good at a game makes you good at life, makes you good at changing the world, and gives you skills that are going to allow you to reinvent your environment.</span></div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">WRIGHT:</span> Well . . . if there’s one aspect of humanity that I want to augment, it’s the imagination, which is probably our most powerful cognitive tool. I think of games as being an amplifier for the imagination of the players, in the same way that a car amplifies our legs or a house amplifies our skin. [. . .]</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The human imagination is this amazing thing. We’re able to build models of the world around us, test out hypothetical scenarios, and, in some sense, simulate the world. I think this ability is probably one of the most important characteristics of humanity.<a id="filepos732755" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos984509" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">7</sup><br class="calibre3"/>7</a></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Why does Wright believe that augmenting our natural capacity for imagination is so important at this precise moment in human history? It’s a matter of survival, pure and simple.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The name <span class="italic">Spore</span> is itself an important clue: the definition of a spore, in biology, is “a reproductive structure that is adapted for dispersal and surviving for extended periods of time in unfavorable conditions.”<a id="filepos733374" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos984877" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">8</sup><br class="calibre3"/>8</a> It’s a perfect metaphor for the present circumstances of the human race.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We have collectively entered into what is all but certain to be a time of increasingly unfavorable planetary conditions, largely of our own making—an unstable climate, extreme weather, and an increasingly depleted environment. We need to adapt for survival. We need to imagine planetary-scale solutions and disperse them as far and wide as possible.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We need to become like spores ourselves.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And there’s an explicit call to action to do so, for players who complete all five stages of the game successfully. <span class="italic">Spore</span> has what game developers call a “primary win condition”: a supergoal that represents the ultimate achievement in the game. The primary win condition in <span class="italic">Spore</span> is to develop your single-cell creature into such a successful intergalactic space-faring civilization that it eventually reaches one galactic destination in particular: a super-massive black hole at the center of the galaxy.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Players who reach the black hole receive a “staff of life,” which allows them to transform any planet in the <span class="italic">Spore</span> galaxy into a vibrant, diverse ecosystem: teeming with plants and creatures of all kinds, with breathable atmosphere, sustainable food webs, and plentiful water supply. (No wonder players also refer to it as the “Genesis device.”)</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The staff of life is a shortcut to making an otherwise uninhabitable planet inhabitable. Along with the staff of life, players receive a special message and mission:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">You have traveled very far and overcome many obstacles. Your creative efforts have not gone unnoticed. Your heroic efforts have proven you deserving, worthy of advancement to the next level of your existence. You are now to be given the power. Yes, that’s right, THE POWER. The power to create and spread life, intelligence and understanding throughout the cosmos. Use this power wisely. There is a wonderful opportunity to start on one particular planet: Look for the third rock from <span class="italic">Sol</span>.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">Sol</span> is Latin for “sun,” and so the <span class="italic">Spore</span> community has translated this final message from the game as a playful imperative to remake our own Earth—which is, of course, the third rock from our sun.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In the end, a win in <span class="italic">Spore</span> is a push back to the real world. Players are told, “Your gameplay has prepared you to become a real creator and protector of life on Earth.” Not by making them an expert in geoengineering, atmospheric science, or ecological planning, certainly, but rather by creating the seed of planetary creativity and activism. As Wright said at the <span class="italic">Seed</span> salon:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">All of the really tough problems we’re facing now are planetary problems. There’s real value in being pushed toward global awareness and looking long-term. That’s one of the things that I find very useful about games.... I think these are the timelines we need to be looking at—the one-hundred- or two-hundred-year horizons. Because most of the really bad stuff that’s happening right now is the result of very short-term thinking.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We can break free of the cognitive chains of short-term isolated thinking, with games that direct our collective attention to the future and challenge us to take a global perspective.</span></div>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="013" src="images/00014.jpg" class="calibre5"/></div><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">GOD GAMES LIKE</span>
<span class="italic">Spore</span> have gotten us successfully started on this journey. Now a different genre of games can get us where we need to go: massively multiplayer forecasting games, or <span class="bold1">forecasting games</span> for short.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Forecasting games combine collective intelligence with planetary-scale simulation. They ask players to reimagine and reinvent the way we feed ourselves, the way we transport ourselves, the way we get water, the way we design cities, the way we manufacture everything, the way we power our lives. They’re designed to create diverse communities capable of investigating the long-term challenges we face, propose imaginative solutions, and coordinate our efforts to start putting our best ideas into action at the planetary scale.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s a process I call <span class="bold1">massively multiplayer foresight</span>. And future-forecasting games are the perfect tool for helping as many people participate in the process as possible.<a id="filepos738653" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos985132" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">9</sup><br class="calibre3"/>9</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Which brings us to our final fix for reality:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">FIX # 14 : MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER FORESIGHT</span></span></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Reality is stuck in the present. Games help us imagine and invent the future together.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">How exactly does massively multiplayer foresight work? The best way to understand the process is to start with the project that inspired the forecasting game genre.</span></div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">World Without Oil: Play It Before You Live It</span></span></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">You know it’s bad for you.</span>
<br class="calibre3"/><span class="italic">You’ll cut back someday.</span>
<br class="calibre3"/><span class="italic">On April 30, join a World Without Oil—and play it before you live it.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">—Announcement for the game</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In April 2007, the world ran out of oil.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It didn’t run completely out of oil—it simply ran out of <span class="italic">enough</span> oil. The daily demand for oil worldwide began to outpace our daily production capacity. Shortages broke out, reserves were tapped, and yet the gap between global supply and demand grew wider.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The United States was among the hardest countries hit. During the darkest days of the crisis, as many as 22 percent of Americans were unable to get access to gas, while one in ten U.S. companies buckled under the strain of higher fuel costs and diminished operating capacity.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Two main strategies emerged to deal with the oil crisis.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We could collectively reduce our daily demand for petroleum in order to create equilibrium with the available supply.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Or we could compete even more aggressively for the available oil—with our own individual neighbors, with other companies, with other states, and with other countries.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Of course, this didn’t really happen—at least not for most of us.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But for two thousand online gamers, this peak-oil scenario was the basis for a life-changing six-week experiment: a collaborative simulation designed to find out what <span class="italic">would</span> happen if demand for oil did eventually outstrip our supply, and what we could collectively do about it.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The project was called World Without Oil (WWO), and it was the first massively scaled effort to engage ordinary individuals in creating an immersive forecast of the future.</span></div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">HOW TO PLAY WORLD WITHOUT OIL</span></span></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">At heart World Without Oil is very simple. It’s a “What if?” game.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What if an oil crisis started today—what would happen? How would the lives of ordinary people change?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What would you do to survive the crisis? How would you help others?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Let’s play “What if?” and find out.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Create your own story of life during the oil crisis—and share it with us by e-mail or by phone call, by photos or by blog post, by videos or podcasts.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Then join our citizen “nerve center” at <a href="http://worldwithoutoil.org" class="calibre11">worldwithoutoil.org<br class="calibre3"/>Worldwithoutoil.org 世界无劳工组织</a> to track events and share solutions. Every day, we’ll update you with news about the crisis, and highlight our favorite stories from across the country and around the world.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">No expert knows better than you do how an oil shock could impact your family, your job, your town, your life. So tell us what you know.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Because the best way to change the future is to play with it first.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and presented by the Independent Television Service (ITVS), World Without Oil was first conceived by Ken Eklund, an independent writer and interactive developer based in San Jose, California. He pitched the idea in response to an ITVS announcement of funds up to $100,000 being made available for innovative educational online games. I was invited by ITVS to serve on the evaluating committee for online game proposals.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">“No one today has a clear picture of oil availability or what will happen when demand inevitably outstrips supply,” Eklund wrote in his proposal. “That will largely depend on how well ordinary people respond to the crisis. Until now, no one has ever thought to ask them what they might do. WWO will evoke the wisdom of crowds in advance, as players work together to gain grassroots insights into the forces that will rule at street level in a crisis—and figure out the best ways to prepare, cooperate, and collectively create solutions if and when a real peak-oil shortage happens.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It was designed as a massively multiplayer thought experiment: players would spend six weeks imagining how such a crisis might play out in their local communities, their industries, and their own lives. They would make highly personal forecasts using online social media. And they would rely on an “alternate reality dashboard” to get daily updates on the scenario, in the form of fictional news stories, video reports, and economic indicators from the peak-oil crisis in order to flesh out their personal forecasts in more detail.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Players would also be strongly encouraged to take the simulation a step further, and spend some time each day living their real lives as if the simulated oil shortage were true. How hard would it be to get to work, or to prepare dinner, or to see friends and family if the fictional simulation were real? Players were challenged to test their own ability to adapt, rapidly and dramatically, to a potential oil crisis. Instead of just imagining a peak-oil scenario, they could start making changes and testing adaptive solutions for real.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Each day in real time would represent a week in the simulation. This would enable players to consider longer-term impacts and strategies. The game itself would last for thirty-two days, so the scenario could play out over thirty-two weeks.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">WWO would give players firsthand insight into a plausible future, helping them prepare for, or even prevent, its worst outcomes. The game would also create a collective record of how a real peak-oil scenario might play out—a kind of survival guide for the future, a record of tremendous value for educators, policy makers, and organizations of all kinds.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I happily accepted Eklund’s invitation to join the project team as the game’s “participation architect”—a fancy way of saying my job was to help make sure every single player found a way to contribute meaningfully to the collaborative effort.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Of course, to start, we had to attract a community of players. I set our target at one thousand players, a number based on my experience with online communities and collective intelligence. One thousand participants seems to me to be a critical threshold to allow for an online game to get interesting—to ensure enough diversity among players, to have enough participants to tackle missions on an epic scale, and to produce enough chaotic interaction to generate complex and surprising results.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">For six weeks before we launched, we spread the word online and at public events. We asked our friends and colleagues to blog about it. I announced the game in my keynote for the Serious Games Summit, an annual two-day meeting in San Francisco for people working on games designed to teach, train, and solve real problems. ITVS reached out to educators and media creators across the country. There wasn’t any other marketing plan or promotional budget for the game. It was simply an open, public invitation to simulate the future, and the game was free to play.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">So who showed up to play? They numbered just over nineteen hundred (nearly doubling our initial goal), evenly divided between men and women, and representing all fifty United States and a dozen countries abroad. Most players were in their twenties or thirties, but there were notable clusters of every age group, from teenagers to seniors. And our most active players brought together an astonishingly diverse range of personal concerns and real-life expertise to the game. For example:<div class="calibre28"><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• Peakprophet, a self-described “hobby farmer” in Tennessee, who forecast the collapse of the fresh-food supply chain—and then took it upon himself to train other players how to grow their own food and increase their food self-sufficiency.</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• Lead_tag, a soldier stationed in Iraq, who blogged every single day of the game, creating a series of thirty-two reflections on the challenges of fighting a war during an oil crisis.</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• Anda, a college student pursuing a bachelor of fine arts in graphic design at the San Francisco Art Institute, who created a series of eleven Japanese manga-style Web comics about how she and her friends would help each other during the oil crisis, and how it might affect their ability to find work after graduation.</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• OrganizedChaos, a dispatcher at a General Motors plant in Detroit, who contributed fifty-five blog posts, videos, and podcasts, and found herself forecasting that pretty soon—peak oil or not—she would no longer have a job. As a result, at the end of the game she decided to go back to school in real life to prepare for a new career in a postoil economy.</span></blockquote></div></div><div class="calibre8"> </div></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Once we’d assembled our forecasting community, it was crucial for us that a significant portion of our players stay engaged with the game for its entire six-week duration. That’s because when it comes to future forecasting, our first ideas are often the most obvious and generalized, and therefore the least useful. It takes a while, even for an experienced forecaster, to drill down to the most interesting specifics and spin off unexpected possibilities. So we adopted several strategies to keep players engaged and actively investigating different aspects of the scenario.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">First, each game day we added a new piece of information to the mix: rolling brownouts from oil-dependent power companies; airlines canceling flights and dramatically raising the cost of tickets; empty shelves and food shortages due to inability of deliveries to be made to local stores. In return, players told us about difficulties dealing with unreliable power at home; business travelers getting stranded in other countries when airports unexpectedly shut down; public transportation overcrowding in towns and cities with previously underutilized systems; a disruptive uptick in work-from-home days; the rise of bicycle thefts and a new bicycle black market; impromptu homeschooling as a result of gas shortages in suburban and rural areas; and neighborhood pot-luck meals to deal with the food shortage.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Another important tool for continuing participation was our alternate reality dashboard, which included a map depicting thirty-eight different regions, such as the Boston metro area, the Cincinnati-Columbus metro area, the Great Lakes, the High Plains, and the Atlantic South, each with its own set of “power meters” reflecting the local rise and fall in quality of life, economic strength, and social stability. The power meters fluctuated in direct response to player activity. The more positive forecasts they made, the more cooperative strategies they developed, and the more actively they reduced their own collective daily oil consumption, the more favorable the regional metrics. However, if players chose to imagine a darker turn of events, or if they chose to focus on how increased competition might play out, or if they reported significant difficulties or hardships in adapting to a lower-consumption lifestyle, the metrics would reflect increased chaos, rising misery, or even economic collapse. The meters created a clear feedback loop between players’ stories and the scenario updates.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Of course, the sizable online audience that assembled for World Without Oil was also a huge incentive for players to tell the best stories possible. For every active forecaster, we had an additional twenty-five people watching the game and writing about it. This amplification of their ideas helped make the players’ efforts feel more meaningful.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In the end, the game produced more than a hundred thousand online media artifacts—including a core set of more than two thousand future-forecasting documents from the players and tens of thousands more blog posts and articles reflecting on the game and its findings. One reviewer called it a “huge growing, twisting network of news, strategy, activism, and personal expression.”<a id="filepos753549" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos985783" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">10</sup><br class="calibre3"/>10</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">At first, the majority of players focused their efforts on imagining how local, regional, and international competition for oil resources would play out in this new environment of increased scarcity. They exercised a dark imagination, anticipating the worst possible outcomes and the most serious threats. They documented gas theft, riots, food shortages, widespread looting, job loss, school closures, and even military actions worldwide. At a more personal level, they told stories of personal stress, anxiety, and families in crisis.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But over the course of thirty-two weeks, the balance shifted. About halfway through the game, having exhausted their dark imagination, players began focusing on potential solutions. They started imagining best-case-scenario outcomes: new ways of cooperating to consume less, a focus on local community and neighborhood infrastructure, less time spent commuting, the geographic reassembly of extended family, and more time spent in pursuit of a new American dream—happiness built around notions of sustainability, simplicity, and stronger social connectivity.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The game started with near-apocalyptic undertones; it ended with explicit, if cautious, optimism. The best-case-scenario outcomes were posed not as probabilities—and certainly not as inevitabilities—but rather as <span class="italic">plausible</span> possibilities worth working toward.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">There was no explicit prompt to start with dark imagination and only later veer toward optimism. But it is, in fact, a very sound forecasting strategy. Researchers have pointed to a particularly American failure to believe that the worst can really happen, because we’re systematically trained by our culture to focus on the positive. It’s a failure that makes us more susceptible to catastrophic events, like Hurricane Katrina or the 2008 housing market collapse, for example. In <span class="italic">Never Saw It Coming</span>, sociologist Karen Cerulo argues that our collective inability to focus on negative futures is our culture’s biggest blind spot.<a id="filepos755835" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos986163" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">11</sup><br class="calibre3"/>11</a> As one reviewer of Cerulo’s book summed it up: “We are individually, institutionally, and societally hell-bent on wishful thinking.”<a id="filepos756023" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos986420" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">12</sup><br class="calibre3"/>12</a> We are very good at positive thinking, but we tend to avoid articulating worst-case scenarios, which unfortunately makes us more vulnerable to them and less resilient if they occur.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">World Without Oil gave players a space for nonwishful thinking; that’s what created a sense of urgency to find solutions. That mind-set also lent a sense of gravitas and realism to even the most hopeful stories players told later in the game—stories we later compiled into a guide, “A to Z: A World Beyond Oil.”<a id="filepos756630" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos986676" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">13</sup><br class="calibre3"/>13</a> It contains some of the most interesting community solutions players devised and can give you a taste of how massively multifaceted the final collaborative forecast was. Here are a few of my favorite topics from the document:<div class="calibre28"><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• Architecture Without Oil—notes from attendees of a national architecture convention on how to design and build homes for a world without oil</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• Fellowship Without Oil—a collection of sermons and prayers from pastors, ministers, and other spiritual leaders offering guidance for how to act compassionately during the oil crisis</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• Neighborhood Without Oil—guidelines for how to build stronger personal relationships with our geographically closest neighbors, the people most likely to be of assistance to us during an oil crisis</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• Your Mama Without Oil—reflections from mothers of young children on how to parent in a world without oil</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• Zoom Zoom Without Oil—conversations among automotive racing fans about the future of NASCAR and potential partnerships with alternative vehicle races, including electric vehicle races and human-powered vehicle races</span></blockquote></div></div><div class="calibre8"> </div></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">“The forecasts are of astonishing quality,” one reviewer said of WWO afterward. “The players got to the heart of a complex subject.”<a id="filepos758353" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos986997" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">14</sup><br class="calibre3"/>14</a> I think “heart” is a key word here, because players were telling stories about the futures they cared about most—the future of their industry, their religion, or their own town and their children.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">After the game, creative director Ken Eklund reflected on what it had accomplished. “WWO didn’t only raise awareness about oil dependence. It roused our democratic imagination. It made the issues <span class="italic">real</span>, and this in turn led to real engagement and real change in people’s lives. Via the game, players made themselves better citizens.” This is clearly evident in what players reported afterward. One player reported:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">I really mean it when I say WWO changed my life. I really have been using my cloth bags at the stores, walking more/driving less, turning off lights, and, yes, recycling. My friends, family and coworkers have all noticed the difference. In all seriousness, this entire thing has made me a different person. <a id="filepos759494" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos987296" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">15</sup><br class="calibre3"/>15岁</a></span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">While another wrote:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">This experience has been just incredible for me. I’ve learned so much and started to think about even small things in my daily life in new ways.... Your stories and suggestions give me hope, that good ideas are emerging, that people are reaching out to help each other through these times, that necessary skills and knowledge are being saved and treasured for times when we will need them desperately.

<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Today, the entire simulation has been preserved in a sort of online time machine at <a href="http://Worldwithoutoil.org" class="calibre11">Worldwithoutoil.org<br class="calibre3"/>Worldwithoutoil.org 无劳力世界组织</a>, where you can experience the game from day one all the way through day thirty-two. Each day of gameplay is captured in time so you can see exactly how the collaboration unfolded; there are also guidelines for playing the game yourself today—on your own, with your family, with colleagues, with a classroom, or with your neighbors. In fact, the simulation has been repeated many times at a smaller scale to help individuals and communities prepare themselves, and invent their own solutions, for living in a world beyond oil.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">PERHAPS YOU’RE WONDERING</span>—as many people have asked me since—why did the players participate?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Why would anyone want to play a serious game like World Without Oil instead of a fantasy game, an escapist game, a completely feel-good game?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I asked myself the same question—before WWO launched, while it was being played and afterward, even when we had proof that players were enjoying themselves and audiences found it compelling to watch the project unfold.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Here’s what I’ve come to believe about a game like WWO. By turning a real problem into a voluntary obstacle, we activated more genuine interest, curiosity, motivation, effort, and optimism than we would have otherwise. We can change our real-life behaviors in the context of a fictional game precisely because there isn’t any negative pressure surrounding the decision to change. We are motivated purely by positive stress and by our own desire to engage with a game in more satisfying, successful, social, and meaningful ways.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I also firmly believe that many gamers want to do something that matters in the real world as much as their efforts matter in the game world. One player summed this up best:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Looking back at World Without Oil, I think it is the most amazing, best multiplayer game I have experienced. Usually gaming takes time away from accomplishing useful things in real life, but WWO taught me a lot, lowered my electric bill, and got me focused on doing things that matter to me. <a id="filepos763033" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos987942" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">17</sup><br class="calibre3"/>17</a></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Gamers are ready and willing to take on challenges outside of strictly virtual environments. Meanwhile, people who don’t ordinarily play games are happy to do so when it can help make a difference in the real world.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The numbers are still small. Two thousand players doesn’t begin to compare with <span class="italic">Spore</span>’s active community of more than a million. But unlike <span class="italic">Spore</span>, which represents roughly two decades of some of the smartest computer programmers, some of the most creative game designers, and some of the most brilliant artists in the world working together to advance the genre of planetary simulation and god games (<span class="italic">SimEarth</span> was released in 1990), we are essentially still in the <span class="italic">Pong</span> days of future-forecasting games. (With the operating budget of <span class="italic">Pong</span> to boot.)</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We are <span class="italic">Pong</span>, competing with <span class="italic">Spore</span>. It’s not much of a matchup yet.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But as the field attracts more of the world’s best programmers, storytellers, designers, and artists, as more people are exposed to these games and learn how to play them, and as we invest millions, rather than thousands, of dollars in developing these future worlds, we will grow our future world-building skills just as we’ve grown our virtual world-building skills over the past thirty years. With enough attention and investment, we will start to create immersive future environments as engaging as our favorite virtual worlds.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">WORLD WITHOUT OIL</span> changed the lives of many of our players—but it was also a life-changing experience for me.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It was the proof-of-concept game that convinced me we really can save the real world with the right kind of game. It’s the project that inspired me to define my biggest hope for the future: that a game developer would soon be worthy of a Nobel Prize.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I’ve since taken to advertising that goal everywhere I go, in the hopes of inspiring other game developers to join me in my mission. Of course, both inside and outside the game industry, when I suggest the idea, I’m often met with skepticism. How could a game possibly accomplish enough real-world good to warrant such a prize?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Even on the heels of a project as promising as World Without Oil, it’s true that winning a Nobel Prize is a fairly bold ambition. But consider this: Albert Einstein, who won his own Nobel Prize in physics in 1921, once famously said, “Games are the most elevated form of investigation.” This quotation appears in multiple biographies of Einstein and circulates widely in various collections of famous sayings, but, interestingly, its origins remain elusive. No one seems to have recorded the context of Einstein’s statement—when or where he said it, or what he meant by it. Why would an esteemed physicist call <span class="italic">games</span>, and not <span class="italic">science</span>, the most elevated form of investigation? It’s an unsolved mystery—one I’ve spent much of my free time puzzling over.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Although of course I can’t say for sure I’ve solved the mystery, I do have a theory. And it comes directly from working on World Without Oil.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Einstein, we know from many biographers, was a gamer—albeit a sometimes reluctant one. He had a lifelong love-hate relationship with the game of chess. He played it enthusiastically as a child, although he gave it up for much of his adult life, even once insisting to the <span class="italic">New York Times</span>, “I do not play any games. There is no time for it. When I get through work I don’t want anything which requires the working of the mind.”<a id="filepos767217" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos988281" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">18</sup><br class="calibre3"/>18岁</a> Yet many friends and colleagues recall playing countless games of chess with Einstein, particularly later in his life.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Historians have suggested that Einstein avoided chess during the height of his scientific career precisely because he loved it so much and found it so distracting. “Chess holds its master in its own bonds,” he once said, “shackling the mind and brain.”<a id="filepos767702" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos988557" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">19</sup><br class="calibre3"/>19</a> In other words, when he started thinking about chess, he found himself unable to stop. Why? Most likely because, as so many chess masters have noted, the game is an incredibly compelling problem that becomes more compelling the longer you think about it.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The central problem of chess is perfectly constructed, clear, and constrained : how do you manipulate a set of sixteen resources of different abilities in order to capture your opponent’s most valuable asset, while simultaneously protecting your own? But it can be approached with endlessly many different strategies, each strategic effort changing the future possibilities in the problem space. As one famous chess saying goes, “Chess is infinite.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">There are 400 different positions after each player makes one move apiece. There are 72,084 positions after two moves apiece. There are 9-plus million positions after three moves apiece. There are 288-plus billion different possible positions after four moves apiece. There are more potential games than the number of electrons in our universe.<a id="filepos768981" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos988686" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">20</sup><br class="calibre3"/>20</a></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The possibility space of chess is so massive and complex, one individual has no hope of understanding or exploring it fully—even if one spends a lifetime, as many chess players do, investigating it.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Fortunately, while chess is a two-player game, it is also a massively multiplayer project. The global community of chess players has collaborated for centuries to explore and document its problem space as thoroughly and imaginatively as possible. Indeed, for as long as modern players have played chess, they have recorded their games, shared strategies, formalized successful approaches, and published them for others’ benefit. Even after centuries of collective play, the chess community continues to seek a better understanding of the problem, to invent more surprising and successful approaches, and to hold the massively many possibilities of the game in their head as they drive the sum human understanding of the game forward, one move at a time.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">To play chess as a more than casual player is to become a part of this problem-solving network. It means joining a massively collaborative effort to become intimately familiar with an otherwise unfathomably complex possibility space. And that’s what I believe Einstein meant when he described games as an elevated form of investigation. When enough people play a game, it becomes a massively collaborative study of a problem, an extreme-scale test of potential action in a specific possibility space.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I believe that’s the direction we’re heading with forecasting games. These games help us identify a real-world problem and study it from massively multiple points of view. They present the problem in a compelling way, and they help us compile a record of massively multiple strategies for addressing it. They give us a safe space to play out the possible consequences of each and every possible move we could make. And they help us anticipate the massively multiple moves that others could conceivably take.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">That’s actually what we tried to do with World Without Oil. We defined a problem: an oil shortage, with no available means of increasing supply. There was a clear goal: to resolve the imbalance between supply and demand. The possible strategies were infinite. We asked players to craft their own strategies, based on their own unique points of view: a combination of location, age, life experience, and personal values. We asked them to test, on a local scale, different actions, and to report their findings. Taken together, all the players’ stories and solutions represent massively multiple perspectives on the same problem. It was a truly elevated investigation.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And in a world of changing climate, geopolitical tensions, and economic instabilities, there are plenty more problems to be tackled with our collective imagination.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">If we can develop the same kind of intelligence about the real problems we face as players do about their favorite games, then we <span class="italic">will</span> be able to practice better planet craft. We’ll elevate our collective understanding of the challenges we face. And we’ll build a global community of individuals ready to play a role in discerning the right moves to make in the future.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">At the end of World Without Oil, I was struck by how optimistic players were. Despite having spent nearly a month imagining incredibly dark forecasts, our players wound up feeling better—not worse—about the future and their ability to impact it. They experienced a sense of improved capability, greater resilience, and realistic hope.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In other words, they became what futurist Jamais Cascio calls “super-empowered hopeful individuals,” or SEHIs.<a id="filepos773226" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos989010" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">21</sup><br class="calibre3"/>二十一岁</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">A <span class="bold1">SEHI</span> (pronounced <span class="italic">SEH-hee</span>) is someone who feels not just optimistic about the future, but also <span class="italic">personally capable</span> of changing the world for the better. According to Cascio, SEHIs get their confidence from network technologies that amplify and aggregate individual ability to impact the common good.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Cascio coined the term “SEHI” in contrast to another term, “super-empowered angry men,” which <span class="italic">New York Times</span> columnist Thomas Friedman used in his writing about terrorism in a globally networked age. Osama bin Laden, Friedman wrote, seeks to create super-empowered angry men who feel capable of leaving their mark on the world, in terrible ways.<a id="filepos774071" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos989369" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">22</sup><br class="calibre3"/>22</a> In response, Cascio explains:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">The core of the “super-empowered angry individual” (SEAI) argument is that some technologies may enable individuals or small groups to carry out attacks, on infrastructure or people, at a scale that would have required the resources of an army in decades past.... But angry people aren’t the only ones who could be empowered by these technologies. As a parallel, the core of the “super-empowered hopeful individual” (SEHI) argument is that these technologies may also enable individuals or small groups to carry out socially beneficial actions at a scale that would have required the resources of a large NGO or business in decades past.<a id="filepos774896" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos989625" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">23</sup><br class="calibre3"/>23</a></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">SEHIs don’t wait around for the world to save itself. They invent and spread their own humanitarian missions. More importantly, they are “able to do so with smaller numbers, greater speed, and a far larger impact” than a slow-moving, risk-averse organization. Of course, in an ideal world, SEHIs would be able to band together and scale up their efforts—to avoid making redundant efforts, to learn from each other’s mistakes, to amplify each other’s abilities to make a difference. Disorganized SEHIs would have a hard time making significant strides. But organized SEHIs—well, they could change everything.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">So a year after the World Without Oil experiment, Cascio and I teamed up at the Institute for the Future to find as many of those millions of SEHIs as possible—to give them a platform for organizing, and a new game to play.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It was called Superstruct, and its promise was simple: Play the game, invent the future.</span></div>
