<span class="bold">The Four Secrets to Making Our Own Happiness</span>
</span></span><br class="calibre13"/>
让我们自己快乐的四个秘密
</h1><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Many different competing theories of happiness have emerged from the field of positive psychology, but if there’s one thing virtually all positive psychologists agree on, it’s this: there are many ways to be happy, but we cannot <span class="italic">find</span> happiness. No object, no event, no outcome or life circumstance can deliver real happiness to us. We have to <span class="italic">make our own</span> happiness—by working hard at activities that provide their own reward.<a id="filepos117156" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos904449" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">15</sup><br class="calibre3"/>15岁</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When we try to find happiness outside of ourselves, we’re focused on what positive psychologists call “extrinsic” rewards—money, material goods, status, or praise. When we get what we want, we feel good. Unfortunately, the pleasures of found happiness don’t last very long. We build up a tolerance for our favorite things and start to want more. It takes bigger and better rewards just to trigger the same level of satisfaction and pleasure. The more we try to “find” happiness, the harder it gets. Positive psychologists call this process “hedonic adaptation,” and it’s one of the biggest hindrances to long-term life satisfaction. <a id="filepos117902" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos904894" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">16</sup><br class="calibre3"/>16岁</a> The more we consume, acquire, and elevate our status, the harder it is to stay happy. Whether it’s money, grades, promotions, popularity, attention, or just plain material things we want, scientists agree: seeking out external rewards is a sure path to sabotaging our own happiness.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">On the other hand, when we set out to make our own happiness, we’re focused on activity that generates <span class="italic">intrinsic</span> rewards—the positive emotions, personal strengths, and social connections that we build by engaging intensely with the world around us. We’re not looking for praise or payouts. The very act of what we’re doing, the enjoyment of being fully engaged, is enough.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The scientific term for this kind of self-motivated, self-rewarding activity is <span class="italic">autotelic</span> (from the Greek words for “self,” <span class="italic">auto</span>, and “goal,” <span class="italic">telos</span>).<a id="filepos118906" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos905506" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">17</sup><br class="calibre3"/>17</a> We do autotelic work because it engages us completely, and because intense engagement is the most pleasurable, satisfying, and meaningful emotional state we can experience.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As long as we are regularly immersed in self-rewarding hard work, we will be happy more often than not—no matter what else is going on in our lives. This is one of the earliest hypotheses of positive psychology, and a fairly radical idea. It contradicts what so many of us have been taught to believe—that we need life to be a certain way in order for us to be happy, and that the easier life is the happier we are. But the relationship between hard work, intrinsic reward, and lasting happiness has been verified and confirmed through hundreds of studies and experiments.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">One well-known study conducted at the University of Rochester, published in 2009, neatly upturns one of the most common assumptions about how happiness works. Researchers tracked 150 recent college graduates for two years, monitoring their goals and reported happiness levels. They compared the rates at which the graduates achieved both extrinsic and intrinsic rewards, with self-reported levels of well-being and life satisfaction. The researchers’ unequivocal conclusion: “The attainment of extrinsic, or ‘American Dream,’ goals—money, fame, and being considered physically attractive by others—<span class="italic">does not contribute to happiness at all.</span>” In fact, they reported, far from creating well-being, achieving extrinsic rewards “actually does contribute to some ill-being.” If we let our desire for more and more extrinsic rewards monopolize our time and attention, it prevents us from engaging in autotelic activities that would actually increase our happiness.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">On the other hand, in the same study the University of Rochester researchers found that individuals who focused on intrinsically rewarding activity, working hard to develop their personal strengths and build social relationships, for example, were measurably happier over the entire two-year period <span class="italic">completely regardless of external life circumstances</span> like salary or social status.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">This research confirms what dozens of other major studies have found: happiness derived from intrinsic reward is incredibly resilient. Every time we engage in autotelic activities, the very opposite of hedonic adaptation occurs. We wean ourselves off consumption and acquisition as sources of pleasure and develop our <span class="italic">hedonic resilience</span>. As research psychologist Sonja Lyubomirsky, a leading expert on intrinsic reward, explains: “One of the chief reasons for the durability of happiness activities is that . . . they are hard won. You’ve devoted time and effort.... You have made these practices happen, and you have the ability to make them happen again. This sense of capability and responsibility is a powerful boost in and of itself.” In other words, we become better able to protect and strengthen our quality of life, regardless of external circumstances. We rely less and less on unreliable and short-lived external rewards and take control of our own happiness. “When the source of positive emotion is yourself . . . , it can continue to yield pleasure and make you happy. When the source of positive emotion is yourself, it is <span class="italic">renewable</span>.”<a id="filepos122454" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos905733" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">18</sup><br class="calibre3"/>18岁</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The prevailing positive-psychology theory that we are the one and only source of our own happiness isn’t just a metaphor. It’s a biological fact. Our brains and bodies produce neurochemicals and physiological sensations that we experience, in different quantities and combinations, as pleasure, enjoyment, satisfaction, ecstasy, contentment, love, and every other kind of happiness. And positive psychologists have shown that we don’t need to wait for life to trigger these chemicals and sensations for us. We can trigger them ourselves through scientifically measurable autotelic activities.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In fact, from a neurological and physiological point of view, “intrinsic reward” is really just another way of describing the emotional payoffs we get by stimulating our internal happiness systems.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">By undertaking a difficult challenge, such as trying to finish a task in a shorter time than usual, we can produce in our own bodies a rush of adrenaline, the excitement hormone that makes us feel confident, energetic, and highly motivated.<a id="filepos123714" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos905992" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">19</sup><br class="calibre3"/>19</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">By accomplishing something that is very hard for us, like solving a puzzle or finishing a race, our brains release a potent cocktail of norepinephrine, epinephrine, and dopamine. These three neurochemicals in combination make us feel satisfied, proud, and highly aroused.<a id="filepos124098" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos906282" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">20</sup><br class="calibre3"/>20</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When we make someone else laugh or smile, our brain is flooded with dopamine, the neurotransmitter associated with pleasure and reward. If we laugh or smile, too, the effect is even more pronounced.<a id="filepos124409" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos906711" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">21</sup><br class="calibre3"/>二十一岁</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Every time we coordinate or synchronize our physical movements with others, such as in dance or sports, we release oxytocin into our bloodstream, a neurochemical that makes us feel blissed out and ecstatic.<a id="filepos124728" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos906974" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">22</sup><br class="calibre3"/>22</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When we seek out what we might describe as “powerful” and “moving” stories, media, or live performances, we’re actually triggering our vagus nerve, which makes us feel emotionally “choked up” in our chests and throats, or we’re firing up our nervous system’s pilomotor reflex, which gives us pleasurable chills and goose bumps.<a id="filepos125168" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos907204" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">23</sup><br class="calibre3"/>23</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And if we provoke our curiosity by exposing ourselves to ambiguous visual stimulus, like a wrapped present or a door that is just barely ajar, we experience a rush of “interest” biochemicals also known as “internal opiates.” These include endorphins, which make us feel powerful and in control, and beta-endorphin, a “well-being” neurotransmitter that is eighty times more powerful than morphine.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Few of us set out intentionally to trigger these systems. We don’t think of happiness as a process of tapping strategically into our neurochemistry. We just know what feels good and meaningful and satisfying, and that’s the kind of activity we’ll do for its own sake.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Of course, we’ve also developed many external shortcuts to triggering our hardwired happiness systems: addictive drugs and alcohol, rich but unhealthy food, and chronic shopping, to name a few. But none of these methods are sustainable or effective in the long term. As scientists have shown, hedonic adaptation to extrinsic reward will cause our shortcut happiness behaviors to spiral out of control until they no longer work or we can no longer afford them, or even until they kill us.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Fortunately, we don’t have to fight this losing battle. As long as we’re focused on intrinsic and not extrinsic reward, we never run out of the raw materials for making our own happiness. We’re hardwired with neurochemical systems to make all the happiness we need. We just have to work hard at things that activate us and immerse ourselves in challenging activities we enjoy for their own sake.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Writer and self-described happiness explorer Elizabeth Gilbert puts it best: “Happiness is the consequence of personal effort.... You have to participate relentlessly in the manifestations of your own blessings.”<a id="filepos127274" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos907341" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">24</sup><br class="calibre3"/>24</a> We have the biological capability to create our own happiness through hard work. And the harder we work to experience intrinsic rewards, the stronger our internal happiness-making capabilities become.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">SO WHICH INTRINSIC</span> rewards, exactly, are most essential to our happiness? There’s no definitive list, but a few key ideas and examples appear over and over again in the scientific literature. My analysis of significant positive-psychology findings from the past decade suggests that intrinsic rewards fall into four major categories.<a id="filepos127962" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos907537" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">25</sup><br class="calibre3"/>25</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">First and foremost, we crave <span class="bold1">satisfying work</span>, every single day. The exact nature of this “satisfying work” is different from person to person, but for everyone it means being immersed in clearly defined, demanding activities that allow us to see the direct impact of our efforts.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"> <br class="calibre3"/></span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Second, we crave <span class="bold1">the experience, or at least the hope, of being successful.</span> We want to feel powerful in our own lives and show off to others what we’re good at. We want to be optimistic about our own chances for success, to aspire to something, and to feel like we’re getting better over time.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Third, we crave <span class="bold1">social connection</span>. Humans are extremely social creatures, and even the most introverted among us derive a large percentage of our happiness from spending time with the people we care about. We want to share experiences and build bonds, and we most often accomplish that by doing things that matter together.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Fourth, and finally, we crave <span class="bold1">meaning</span>, or the chance to be a part of something larger than ourselves. We want to feel curiosity, awe, and wonder about things that unfold on epic scales. And most importantly, we want to belong to and contribute to something that has lasting significance beyond our own individual lives.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">These four kinds of intrinsic rewards are the foundation for optimal human experience. They’re the most powerful motivations we have other than our basic survival needs (food, safety, and sex). And what these rewards all have in common is that they’re all ways of engaging deeply with the world around us—with our environment, with other people, and with causes and projects bigger than ourselves.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">IF INTRINSIC REWARD</span> is so much more satisfying and effective in boosting our happiness than extrinsic reward, then shouldn’t we all naturally spend most of our time tackling unnecessary obstacles and engaging in autotelic activity?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Unfortunately, as Sonja Lyubomirsky eloquently explains: “We have been conditioned to believe that the wrong things will make us lastingly happy.”<a id="filepos130673" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos908155" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">26</sup><br class="calibre3"/>26</a> We’ve been sold the American dream. And increasingly, it’s not just Americans who are giving up real happiness in favor of the pursuit of wealth, fame, and beauty. Thanks to the globalization of consumer and popular culture, everyone on the planet is being sold the same dream of extrinsic reward. This is especially true in emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil, where more and more people are being ushered onto the global hedonic treadmill, encouraged to consume more and to compete for limited natural resources as a way to increase their quality of life.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But there is cause for hope. One group is opting out of this soul-deadening, planet-exhausting hedonic grind, and in larger and larger numbers: hard-core gamers.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Games, after all, are the quintessential autotelic activity. We only ever play because we want to. Games don’t fuel our appetite for extrinsic reward: they don’t pay us, they don’t advance our careers, and they don’t help us accumulate luxury goods. Instead, games enrich us with intrinsic rewards. They actively engage us in satisfying work that we have the chance to be successful at. They give us a highly structured way to spend time and build bonds with people we like. And if we play a game long enough, with a big enough network of players, we feel a part of something bigger than ourselves—part of an epic story, an important project, or a global community.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Good games help us experience the four things we crave most—and they do it safely, cheaply, and reliably.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Good games <span class="italic">are</span> productive. They’re producing a higher quality of life.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When we realize that this <span class="italic">reorientation toward intrinsic reward</span> is what’s really behind the 3 billion hours a week we spend gaming globally, the mass exodus to game worlds is neither surprising nor particularly alarming. Instead, it’s overwhelming confirmation of what positive psychologists have found in their scientific research: self-motivated, self-rewarding activity really does make us happier. More importantly, it’s evidence that gamers aren’t escaping their real lives by playing games.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">They’re actively making their real lives more rewarding.</span></div>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_13"></div>
