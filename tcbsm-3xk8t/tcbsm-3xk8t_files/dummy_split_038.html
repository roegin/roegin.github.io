<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Maybe these aren’t exactly your typical doctor’s orders. In fact, I’m pretty sure no psychologist has ever prescribed these activities. But each of these three unusual instructions <span class="italic">is</span> directly inspired by practical recommendations taken straight from positive-psychology manuals. For example:<div class="calibre28"><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• Practice random acts of kindness twice a week. (The reward center of the brain experiences a stronger “dopamine hit” when we make someone else smile than when we smile first.)</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• Think about death for five minutes every day. (Researchers suggest that we can induce a mellow, grateful physiological state known as “posttraumatic bliss” that helps us appreciate the present moment and savor our lives more.)</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• Dance more. (Synchronizing physical behavior to music we like is one of the most reliable—not to mention the safest—ways to induce the form of extreme happiness known as euphoria.)</span></blockquote></div></div><div class="calibre8"> </div></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">These three guidelines represent some of the most commonly prescribed happiness activities today; the first set of instructions just offers more <span class="italic">gameful</span> interpretations of them.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What, exactly, are happiness activities? They’re like the daily multivitamins of positive psychology: they’ve been clinically tested and proven to boost our well-being in small doses, and they’re designed to fit easily into our everyday lives. There are dozens of different happiness activities in the scientific literature to choose from in addition to the three listed above, ranging from expressing our gratitude to someone daily to making a list of “bright-side” benefits whenever we experience a negative life event. And they all have one thing in common: they are backed by multiple million-dollar-plus research studies, which have conclusively demonstrated that virtually anybody who adopts one as a regular habit <span class="italic">will</span> get happier.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Of course, if it were <span class="italic">that</span> easy, we’d all be a lot happier already. In fact, by nearly all measures, we’re <span class="italic">not</span> substantially happier as a planet than we were before the rise of positive psychology in the 1990s. Rates of both clinical depression and mild depression globally are increasing so quickly, the World Health Organization recently named depression the single most serious chronic threat to global health, beating out heart disease, asthma, and diabetes.<a id="filepos456059" href="dummy_split_077.html#filepos955769" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">1</sup><br class="calibre3"/>1</a> In the United States, where we frequently put on happy faces for each other in public, we admit in private to surprisingly low levels of life satisfaction. In one recent nationwide survey, more than 50 percent of U.S. adults recently reported that they “lack great enthusiasm for life” and “don’t feel actively and productively engaged with the world.”<a id="filepos456466" href="dummy_split_077.html#filepos956123" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">2</sup><br class="calibre3"/>2</a> This is despite the fact that we have—more than ever before—better and wider access to evidence-based self-help tools in the form of best-selling positive-psychology books, not to mention countless magazine articles and blog posts.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">So what’s the problem? It turns out that <span class="italic">knowing</span> what makes us happy isn’t enough. We have to act on that knowledge, and not just once, but often. And it’s becoming increasingly obvious that it is just not that easy to put scientific findings into practice in our everyday lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We need help implementing new happiness habits—and we can’t just help ourselves. In fact, when it comes to improving our collective happiness levels, self-help rarely works. Outside the structure and social support of a clinical trial or classroom, these self-help recommendations are surprisingly hard to implement on our own. Depending on the activity, we either <span class="italic">can’t</span> or <span class="italic">won’t</span> do them solo—and there are three big reasons why.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The first and most important reason is summed up best by Sonja Lyubomirsky, who laments, “Why do many of the most powerful happiness activities sound so . . . well, hokey?”<a id="filepos457830" href="dummy_split_077.html#filepos956291" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">3</sup><br class="calibre3"/>3</a> Lyubomirsky earned a million-dollar research grant from the National Institute of Mental Health to test a dozen different happiness activities—and she discovered that despite their incontrovertible effectiveness, many people resist even trying them. The most common complaint, according to Lyubomirsky? Happiness activities sound “corny,” “sentimental,” or Pollyannaish.<a id="filepos458255" href="dummy_split_077.html#filepos956423" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">4</sup><br class="calibre3"/>4</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">“Such reactions are authentic, and I can’t dispute them,” Lyubomirsky admits.<a id="filepos458445" href="dummy_split_077.html#filepos956556" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">5</sup><br class="calibre3"/>5</a> We instinctively resist activities that feel forced and inauthentic, and many people are deeply suspicious of unadulterated feel-goodness. Shouldn’t expressions of gratitude be spontaneous, not scheduled? Isn’t it naive to constantly look for silver linings? What if I just plain don’t <span class="italic">feel</span> like making a gesture of kindness today? When it comes to doing good and feeling good, we seem to think it’s more “real” if we wait for inspiration to strike, rather than committing to doing it whether we “feel like it” or not. On top of that, there’s just plain suspicion and skepticism of these unabashedly positive activities. There’s an undeniable tendency toward irony, cynicism, and detachment in popular culture today, and throwing ourselves into happiness activities just doesn’t fit that emotional climate.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Positive psychologist Martin Seligman explains that “the pervasive belief that happiness is inauthentic is a profound obstacle” to putting positive psychology into action.<a id="filepos459543" href="dummy_split_077.html#filepos956684" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">6</sup><br class="calibre3"/>6</a> Science just doesn’t have a chance against our instinctive, visceral reactions—and, unfortunately, the best advice that positive psychologists have to offer seems to push all our cynical, skeptical buttons. For many people, happiness activities will need to be embedded in a more instinctively appealing—and less overtly do-good, feel-good—package.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The second obstacle to practicing simple happiness activities on our own is what I call the “self-help paradox.” Self-help is typically a personal, private activity. When it comes to some activities—overcoming fears, identifying career goals, coping with chronic pain, starting a fitness routine—there’s certainly reason to believe that self-help can work. But when it comes to everyday happiness, there’s just no way personal, private activity can work—because, according to most scientific findings, there are almost no good ways to be happy alone for long.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As the author Eric Weiner, who has studied worldwide happiness trends, reports: “The self-help industrial complex hasn’t helped. By telling us that happiness lives inside us, it’s turned us inward just when we should be looking outward . . . to other people, to community and to the kind of human bonds that so clearly are the sources of our happiness.”<a id="filepos460976" href="dummy_split_077.html#filepos956849" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">7</sup><br class="calibre3"/>7</a> Weiner makes an excellent point here: self-help isn’t typically <span class="italic">social</span>, but so many happiness activities are meant to be. Moreover, positive psychology has shown that for any activity to feel truly <span class="italic">meaningful</span>, it needs to be attached to a much bigger project or community—and self-help just doesn’t usually unfold collectively, particularly when self-help advice comes in the form of books.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Approaching happiness as a self-help process runs counter to virtually every positive-psychology finding ever published. Even if we can get ourselves past the hokiness problem, thinking of happiness as a self-help process will doom us to failure. Ideally, happiness needs to be approached as a <span class="italic">collective</span> process. Happiness activities need to be done with friends, family, neighbors, strangers, coworkers, and all the other people who make up the social fabric of our lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Finally, there’s a self-help problem that isn’t unique to the science of happiness: it’s easier to change minds than to change behaviors. As Harvard professor of psychology Tal Ben-Shahar explains, we’re often more willing to learn something new than we are to actively adapt our lives. “Making the transition from theory to practice is difficult: changing deeply rooted habits of thinking, transforming ourselves and our world, requires a great deal of effort,” he writes. “People often abandon theories when they discover how difficult they are to put into practice.”<a id="filepos462603" href="dummy_split_077.html#filepos957015" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">8</sup><br class="calibre3"/>8</a> Either we never try or we get bored or frustrated quickly.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Toward the end of his best-selling self-help book <span class="italic">Happier</span>, Ben-Shahar makes one last effort to convince people to make practical use of what they’ve read: “There is one easy step to <span class="italic">un</span>happiness—doing nothing.” But unfortunately, that’s exactly what most of us do after we read a book or magazine article about happiness: absolutely nothing. The written word is a powerful way to communicate knowledge—but it’s not necessarily the most effective way to motivate people. We simply can’t self-help our way out of the depression epidemic. Alongside platforms for communicating the science of happiness, we need platforms for <span class="italic">engaging</span> people in scientifically proven happiness activities.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And that’s where ideas like sidewalk compliments, cemetery poker, and stationary dancing come in.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Shout compliments at strangers, play poker in a cemetery, and dance without moving your feet are all instructions from large-scale public games that I’ve designed specifically with the intention of creating opportunities for as many people as possible to participate in happiness activities they wouldn’t ordinarily try.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">These “crowd games”—meant to be played in very large, and usually face-to-face, groups—are called Cruel 2 B Kind, Tombstone Hold ’Em, and Top Secret Dance-Off. And they’re all perfect examples of a new design practice called “happiness hacking.”</span></div>
