<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">—from the Urban Dictionary</span><a id="filepos604138" href="dummy_split_080.html#filepos974125" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">1</sup><br class="calibre3"/>1</a></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">W</span>hat the world needs now are more <span class="bold1">epic wins</span>: opportunities for ordinary people to do extraordinary things—like change or save someone’s life—every day.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">“Epic win” is a gamer term. It’s used to describe a big, and usually surprising, success: a come-from-behind victory, an unorthodox strategy that works out spectacularly well, a team effort that goes much better than planned, a heroic effort from the most unlikely player.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The label “epic” makes these kinds of wins sound rare or exceptional. But in the gamer world, they’re not. Discussion forums are full of gamers sharing their most surprising and rewarding fiero moments. And they come in many different forms.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Some epic wins are about discovering we have abilities we didn’t know we had. One action-adventure gamer writes: “After over an hour of attempting the ridiculously impossible office battle scene in <span class="italic">Indigo Prophecy</span>, which I was sure I’d never finish, I finally passed it, exhausted and wracked with awe. I did <span class="italic">that</span>? Epic win.”<a id="filepos605496" href="dummy_split_080.html#filepos974414" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">2</sup><br class="calibre3"/>2</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Some are about upsetting other people’s expectations of what’s possible. A fantasy-football gamer writes: “I won the Champions League in <span class="italic">Championship Manager</span> coaching huge underdogs Malaga through a simulated season. Now that’s epic. It’s the most unlikely win ever.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And still others are about inventing new positive outcomes we hadn’t even imagined before. A <span class="italic">Grand Theft Auto</span> player reports: “My epic win in GTA IV: Mountain biking to the top of the highest mountain from the city. Takes me 25 minutes real time. Just in time to see the sunrise.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What do these three different kinds of epic wins have in common? They all help us revise our notion of what constitutes a realistic best-case-scenario outcome. Whatever we thought the best possible result could reasonably be before, after an epic win we’ve set a new precedent: We can do more. It can get better.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">With each epic win, our possibility space expands—dramatically. That’s why epic wins are so crucial to creating sustainable economies of engagement. They make us curious about what more we can do—and as a result, we are more likely to take positive action again in the future. Epic wins help turn a one-off effort into passionate long-term participation.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Epic wins abound in gamer circles, for two reasons. First, in the face of ridiculous challenges, long odds, or great uncertainty, gamers cultivate extreme optimism. They have perfect confidence that even if success isn’t <span class="italic">probable</span> , it’s at least possible. So gamers’ efforts to achieve an epic win never feel pointless or hopeless. Second, gamers aren’t afraid to fail. Failing in a good game is at the very least fun and interesting; it can also be instructive and even empowering.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Extreme optimism and fun failure mean that gamers are more likely to put themselves in situations where epic wins can happen—situations where we take up unlikely missions and surprise ourselves with new awe-inspiring positive outcomes.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Ideally, the real world would present us with the same kind of intensely gratifying, save-the-world work flow we get from good games. But in real life, epic wins can be few and far between. We just don’t have the same kind of carefully designed opportunities to surprise ourselves with our own superpowers.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We don’t have an endless stream of opportunities to <span class="italic">do something that matters right now</span>, presented with <span class="italic">clear instructions</span>, and finely tuned to our <span class="italic">moment-by-moment capabilities</span>. Without that kind of creative and logistical support, there’s no easy way to go after epic goals and successfully achieve them in our everyday lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Fortunately, a new genre of games called <span class="bold1">social participation games</span> is trying to change that. They’re designed to give players real-world volunteer tasks that feel as <span class="italic">heroic</span>, as <span class="italic">satisfying</span>, and—most importantly—as <span class="italic">readily achievable</span> as MMORPG quests. And as a result, a growing number of gamers are getting their hands dirty doing real-world good—and improving and saving real lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Take my friend Tom. He’s a young math teacher who lives in Portland, Oregon. He usually gets his epic wins playing <span class="italic">Rock Band</span>, or, as he tells me, “any game where you get to play as Spider-Man or Batman.” But recently, he started playing a social participation game called The Extraordinaries—and it has dramatically expanded his sense of his own potential.</span></div>
