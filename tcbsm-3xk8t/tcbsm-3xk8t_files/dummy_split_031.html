<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">I</span>f I have one regret in life,” I complained to the crowd at the Austin Convention Center, “it’s that my undead priest is smarter than I am.” Technically speaking, it’s true: if you were to add up every A I’ve gotten in my real life, from junior high through graduate school, the total still wouldn’t come close to my <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span> character’s intellect stat. Never mind the fact that there’s no score at all for getting smarter once you’re out of school for good.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I was giving a keynote address at the annual design and technology conference SXSW Interactive when I made this lament. The topic was, naturally, the failures of the real world to be as engaging as a good game, and what we could do to fix it. As I told the crowd, “I’d feel a lot better if I got plus-one intellect for every smart thing I said during this talk. Or at least a few plus-one public speaking points.” Giving talks is exhausting, even when I enjoy it, I explained. It would be energizing to see some +1s pop up right on top of my PowerPoint slides as I worked my way through the deck.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">A few days later, back home in California, I received an e-mail from an unfamiliar sender: ratings@plusoneme.com. The subject was “Clay has acknowledged your strengths.” Clay who? I wondered. I didn’t know anyone named Clay. I opened the e-mail anyway.</span></div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">A friend of yours, Clay Johnson, +1d you to acknowledge some of your strengths. Specifically they’re acknowledging these attributes:</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"> <br class="calibre3"/></span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">+1 Intelligence <br class="calibre3"/>+1 Public Speaking <br class="calibre3"/>+1 Inspiration</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Enjoy your day. And congratulations!</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">A second e-mail arrived a few minutes later, from Clay Johnson himself.</span></div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Your +1 in public speaking as you requested at SXSW! It should have arrived in your inbox a little while ago. When you said that during your speech, I thought, “Why shouldn’t she be able to get a +1 in public speaking?!” and built <a href="http://plusoneme.com" class="calibre11">plusoneme.com<br class="calibre3"/>Plusoneme. com</a>. Great talk. Check out what you inspired.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I followed the link, and sure enough, there was a perfect little Web application dedicated to giving and tracking stats in an array of thirty-seven different personal strengths: creativity, generosity, speed, fashion, listening, and backbone, for example.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It was definitely a broader and more diverse set of stats than I’d even seen in a role-playing game. For every plus-one you send, you can also attach a reason: “+1 backbone for sticking up for our idea in the meeting,” for example, or “+1 endurance for getting through the long drive home tonight.” And you can send a plus-one to anyone via e-mail, regardless of whether or not they’ve signed up to play. If they join the site and create a profile, their plus-ones “stack,” or add up over time. (So far, I’m up to +25 innovation, because I asked my colleagues to plusoneme when I do something innovative at work.)</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">You can add a plus-one feed to your blog or social network page so that your friends and family can see exactly how fast you’re leveling up, in what strengths. All in all, Plusoneme is pretty much exactly what you’d wish for if you wanted to level up in real life—that is, if you wanted to have an objective measure of how much better you’re getting at the things you’re working hard at.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Since he gave me my first plus-one, I’ve gotten to know Clay Johnson better. It turns out that he’s the director emeritus of Sunlight Labs, a community of open-source developers dedicated to making government more transparent and participatory. We’ve had some very interesting conversations about how to use game feedback systems to increase democratic participation. Frankly, I wouldn’t be surprised to see a <a href="http://Plusoneme.gov" class="calibre11">Plusoneme.gov<br class="calibre3"/>Plusoneme. gov</a> someday, to help constituents give better feedback to their elected officials.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Plusoneme isn’t a game—there aren’t any built-in goals, and there are no restrictions on how you give or earn a plus-one. It’s more like a <span class="italic">gesture</span> toward a game, a kind of musing out loud: How would it feel to get constant, real-time positive feedback in our real lives, whenever we’re tackling obstacles and working hard? Would we be more motivated? Would we feel more rewarded? Would we challenge ourselves more?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">A growing number of alternate reality projects suggest that, for all these questions, the answer is a resounding yes. Systems that help us <span class="italic">level up in real life</span>, by providing us with voluntary obstacles related to our real-world activity and by giving us better feedback really can help us make a better effort. And that gives us our next fix:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">FIX # 8 : MEANINGFUL REWARDS WHEN WE NEED THEM MOST</span></span></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Compared with games, reality is pointless and unrewarding. Games help us feel more rewarded for making our best effort.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I hate flying, and I spend a <span class="italic">lot</span> of time hating it—on the order of over 150 hours a year.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I’m a nervous flier. I’ve gotten better over the years, but I still can’t really work on planes, eat on planes, or sleep on planes. I certainly can’t <span class="italic">enjoy</span> myself on planes. Half the time, I literally make myself sick with anxiety. Even after a good flight, I’m so exhausted from the stress and the jet lag that it takes hours or even a whole day or more to recover.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">More than 25 million Americans have a fear of flying, while 52 percent of frequent fliers say that the number one word to describe air travel is “frustrating.” <a id="filepos370654" href="dummy_split_075.html#filepos948941" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">1</sup><br class="calibre3"/>1</a> And this has significant consequences for our health and well-being.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Being out of control is a fundamentally stressful feeling. Researchers have shown that it takes a huge hit on both our happiness and our physical health. And it’s not just in the moment that we’re negatively affected. When we go through an experience that makes us feel endangered or powerless, our immune system suffers and we experience higher levels of anxiety, depression, and pessimism in the hours and days that follow.<a id="filepos371261" href="dummy_split_075.html#filepos949326" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">2</sup><br class="calibre3"/>2</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Games, of course, help put people back in control. Real gameplay is always by definition voluntary; it is always an exercise of our own freedom. Meanwhile, progressing toward goals and getting better at a game instills a sense of power and mastery.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The fact that commercial flying puts so many people on edge, so reliably, makes airports and airplanes the perfect target for a game-design intervention. If we could look forward to flights instead of dreading them, and if we could feel powerful at the start of our trip instead of helpless, the quality of life of frequent fliers worldwide would skyrocket. And the most fearful fliers would be able to go on more of the trips they want to take but currently avoid.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But what would make flying more authentically rewarding? Forget frequent-flier miles and other travel reward programs. If you’re already frustrated or fearful about flying, earning more flights isn’t going to make you any happier.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What we need are <span class="italic">intrinsic</span> reward programs—and two new games for fliers show exactly how it could be done: Jetset, the world’s first video game for airports, and Day in the Cloud, an in-flight scavenger hunt designed to be played plane versus plane, at ten thousand feet and higher.</span></div>
