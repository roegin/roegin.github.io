You’re lost in your thoughts when suddenly a woman’s voice whispers in your ear, “There’s a lover nearby. . .” You look around, but everyone seems as lost in their own world as you were just a few seconds ago. If there’s a lover nearby, you have no idea who it is.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Then you hear the voice again, this time updating you on your game statistics : “Your life is now at level six.” That’s one level higher than it was before the lover passed by.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Some stranger on the street just gave you a life.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But who was it? Is it that kid sitting on the steps now a few buildings behind you, with his earbuds tucked in? He looks like he’s listening to music—but is he listening for lovers, too? Or is the lover that man in the suit with his Bluetooth earpiece, pacing back and forth? He looks like he’s on a business call—but could he be your secret benefactor?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Or has the lover moved on? Perhaps you are on your own again.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">You haven’t gone another half block when the voice interrupts, this time more insistently, “There’s a dancer nearby.” Then, right away: “There’s <span class="italic">another</span> dancer nearby. Your life is now at level four.” Damn! Who just stole two lives from you?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It must be a couple, playing together, because you’ve lost two lives in such rapid succession. You spin around and notice a couple holding hands walking in the opposite direction. They might be wearing headphones under their hoods. You didn’t notice them before, but they must be the dancers. You hurry down the block before they circle back and take another life from you.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Clearly, you need to find some other lovers as quickly as possible, team up, and restore each other’s life levels. If your life falls to zero, you’re out of the game. But how do you discover the other players hidden in the crowd? As the game instructions suggest, “You could find a stranger and ask them, ‘Are you a Lover or a Dancer?’” But that feels too forward, too abrasive. You feel more comfortable scanning the crowd, looking for people who seem to be looking for others. That way, you can gravitate toward the most promising strangers, stand near them, and wait to see if your life level goes up or down.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">If nothing happens, you know they’re not playing the game and you don’t have to bother them. But if your life level goes up, you can try to smile and make eye contact. You can try to show the stranger that you can be trusted....</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Learning how to offer comfort to strangers, and how to receive it, is the primary challenge of a game called, naturally, the Comfort of Strangers. It’s a game for outdoor city spaces, designed by British developers Simon Evans and Simon Johnson. It’s played on PDAs and phones with Bluetooth detection that alert you via your headphones or earpiece whenever other players are within a few yards’ distance. The PDAs automatically detect other players within a few yards and register a gain or loss of life whenever you cross paths. Half the players are “lovers”; they form one team. The other half are “dancers,” and they form the opposing team. If you encounter a player on your team, you gain a life; if you encounter a player on the opposing team, you lose one.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The Comfort of Strangers is played anonymously; you can download and start the application and wander out into the city streets without any idea of who else is playing or how many players there are. There’s no visual or screen element to the game, so you can play it quite discreetly, with your PDA tucked into a pocket. The only clue that you’re playing is that you’re wearing headphones—but it’s easy to blend in with the increasing number of people who wear earbuds or earpieces while out in public spaces.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">At the start of the game, you don’t know what side you’re on. You have to learn whether you’re a lover or a dancer by listening to the voice that whispers in your ear and keeping track of whether your life is going up or down. Everyone starts the game with ten lives, and when only one team remains alive, the game ends.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">According to Evans and Johnson, the game is designed to evoke the feelings of loneliness and anonymity that are a mainstay of urban life—as well as to provide opportunities for strangers to mean something to each other, if only briefly. As they explain, “The game immerses players in the crowd, exposing them to the ambivalent feelings aroused by city life, the freedom of anonymity and its loneliness. Out of the drive to stay in the game, players create ad hoc, or improvised, social groups.”<a id="filepos423119" href="dummy_split_076.html#filepos953151" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">1</sup><br class="calibre3"/>1</a> They have to develop their intuition about how to tell who else is playing, and therefore who represents a part of the game community. They learn to see strangers for the potential relationships they represent, not just as obstacles to avoid as they pass by.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The emotional impact of the Comfort of Strangers is intense. It not only heightens your awareness of the potential for strangers to play a role in your life, it also provokes a real curiosity about others, and a longing to connect. When you start the game, you feel like you might be the only one playing. Each time you encounter another player, it’s reassuring—even if they’re on the other team. When I asked Simon Johnson about the social goals of the game, he told me this was intentional:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">We wanted our players to find some way to connect with the strangers around them, so we tried to make them feel lost and alone. We set the game up to create a degree of uncertainty in players as to who was and was not playing. We played with the boundary between players and nonplayers so that finding another playing stranger always brings you comfort, even if they’re on the opposite side. Because at least they understand your actions, they understand that you are part of the same game.<a id="filepos424576" href="dummy_split_076.html#filepos953546" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">2</sup><br class="calibre3"/>2</a></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The Comfort of Strangers can be a short game or a long game, depending on how willing players are to overcome their hesitations about reaching out to strangers, and depending on how tightly they can learn to stick together in the crowd.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In theory, if such a game became immensely popular, you could play it all the time, as part of your regular routine—you’d simply turn the game on whenever you walked outside and always keep open the possibility of running across another player as you went about your ordinary business. But in practice, while games like this are still relatively new, there isn’t a critical mass of players to accommodate continuous play. Instead, players organize games online and set precise windows of time and playing fields: for example, in a certain neighborhood, during a certain hour, on a particular date. This kind of advanced schedule keeps players anonymous, but ensures there will be enough density of play for players to have a good chance of encountering each other.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Because a critical mass is so important to games like the Comfort of Strangers, in 2008 Evans and Johnson cofounded an annual Bristol-based festival called Interesting Games, or Igfest, for innovative outdoor games. The festival is meant to provide support for and exposure to other game developers who are working to make cities more interesting and friendlier spaces. And it’s one of an increasing number of urban game festivals worldwide—from the annual Come Out &amp; Play festival in New York City, founded in 2006, and the Hide &amp; Seek Weekender festival in London, founded in 2007, to the Urban Play festival in Seoul, South Korea, founded in 2005—that are designed to test the power of games to improve the feeling of community in real-world spaces.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">These outdoor game festivals gather critical masses of players together for an entire week or weekend of games with the aim of helping to introduce these games to the public at large. They also embody our ninth fix for reality in action: <div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">FIX # 9 : MORE FUN WITH STRANGERS</span></span></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Compared with games, reality is lonely and isolating. Games help us band together and create powerful communities from scratch.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What does it mean to create a community from scratch?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s hard to pin down the difference between a community and a crowd, but we know it when we feel it. Community feels <span class="italic">good</span>. It feels like belonging, fitting in, and actively caring about something together. Community typically arises when a group of people who have a common interest start to interact with each other in order to further that interest. It requires <span class="bold1">positive participation</span> from everyone in the group.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In order to turn a group of strangers into a community, you have to follow two basic steps: first, cultivate a shared interest among strangers, and, second, give them the opportunity and means to interact with each other around that interest.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">That’s exactly what a good multiplayer game does best. It focuses the attention of a group of people on a common goal, even if they think they have nothing in common with each other. And it gives them the means and motivation to pursue that goal, even if they had no intention of interacting with each other previously.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Does a game community among strangers last? Not always. Sometimes it lasts only as long as the game itself. The players might never see or talk to each other again. And that’s perfectly okay. We often tend to think of communities as best when they’re long-term and stable, and certainly the strength of a community can grow over time. But communities can also confer real benefits even when they last for mere days, hours, or even minutes.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When we have community, we feel what anthropologists call “communitas,” or spirit of community.<a id="filepos429281" href="dummy_split_076.html#filepos953718" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">3</sup><br class="calibre3"/>3</a> Communitas is a powerful sense of togetherness, solidarity, and social connection. And it protects against loneliness and alienation.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Even a small taste of communitas can be enough to bring us back to the social world if we feel isolated from it, or to renew our commitment to participating actively and positively in the lives of people around us. Experiencing a short burst of community in a space that previously felt uninviting or simply uninteresting can also permanently change our relationship to that space. It becomes a space for us to act and to be of service, not just to pass through or observe.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Comfort of Strangers designers Evans and Johnson believe that experiencing communitas in an everyday game can spark a taste for the kinds of community action that make the world a better place. Learning to improvise with strangers toward a shared goal teaches players what they call “swarm intelligence”—intelligence that makes people better able and more likely to band together toward positive ends. “As we’re making these games, we dream of the other revolutionary things swarm intelligence might make possible. Low-carbon futures, mass creativity, living happily with less.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s not such a radical idea. To see why, let’s look at two other games designed to create unexpected moments of communitas in a specific shared space: Ghosts of a Chance, a game for a national museum, and Bounce, a game for a retirement center. Both groundbreaking projects demonstrate the growing importance of having more fun with strangers and of using games to build our own capacity for community participation.</span></div>
