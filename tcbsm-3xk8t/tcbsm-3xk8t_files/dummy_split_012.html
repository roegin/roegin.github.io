<div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="bold">CHAPTER TWO</span></span></div><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">The Rise of the Happiness Engineers</span></span></div><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">I</span>’m not the first person to notice that reality is broken compared with games, especially when it comes to giving us good, hard work. In fact, the science of happiness was first born thirty-five years ago, when an American psychologist by the name of Mihály Csíkszentmihályi observed the very same thing. In 1975, Csíkszentmihályi published a groundbreaking scientific study called <span class="italic">Beyond Boredom and Anxiety</span>. The focus of the study was a specific kind of happiness that Csíkszentmihályi named <span class="italic">flow</span>: “the satisfying, exhilarating feeling of creative accomplishment and heightened functioning.”<a id="filepos91305" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos900963" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">1</sup><br class="calibre3"/>1</a> He spent seven years researching this kind of intense, joyous engagement: when and where do we experience it most, and how can we create more of it?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Csíkszentmihályi (pronounced <span class="italic">cheek-SENT-me-high</span>) found a depressing lack of flow in everyday life, but an overwhelming abundance of it in games and gamelike activities. His favorite examples of flow-inducing activities were chess, basketball, rock climbing, and partner dancing: all challenging endeavors with a clear goal, well-established rules for action, and the potential for increased difficulty and improvement over time. Most importantly, flow activities were done for pure enjoyment rather than for status, money, or obligation.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">During this kind of highly structured, self-motivated hard work, Csíkszentmihályi wrote, we regularly achieve the greatest form of happiness available to human beings: <span class="italic">intense, optimistic engagement with the world around us.</span> We feel fully alive, full of potential and purpose—in other words, we are completely activated as human beings.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Of course, it’s possible to achieve this kind of extreme activation outside of games. But Csíkszentmihályi’s research showed that flow was most <span class="italic">reliably</span> and most <span class="italic">efficiently</span> produced by the specific combination of self-chosen goals, personally optimized obstacles, and continuous feedback that make up the essential structure of gameplay. “Games are an obvious source of flow,” he wrote, “and play is the flow experience <span class="italic">par excellence</span>.”<a id="filepos93029" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos901143" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">2</sup><br class="calibre3"/>2</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But if games are the most consistent and efficient source of joyous engagement in our lives, he wondered, then why did real life so infrequently resemble a game? Csíkszentmihályi argued that the failure of schools, offices, factories, and other everyday environments to provide flow was a serious moral issue, one of the most urgent problems facing humanity. Why should we needlessly spend the majority of our lives in boredom and anxiety, when games point to a clear and better alternative? “If we continue to ignore what makes us happy,” he wrote, “we shall actively help perpetuate the dehumanizing forces which are gaining momentum day by day.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The solution seemed obvious to Csíkszentmihályi: create more happiness by structuring real work like game work. Games teach us how to create opportunities for freely chosen, challenging work that keeps us at the limits of our abilities, and those lessons can be transferred to real life. Our most pressing problems—depression, helplessness, social alienation, and the sense that nothing we do truly matters—could be effectively addressed by integrating more gameful work into our everyday lives.<a id="filepos94343" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos901275" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">3</sup><br class="calibre3"/>3</a> It wouldn’t be easy, he admitted. But if we failed to at least try to create more flow, we risked losing entire generations to depression and despair.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">He ended his groundbreaking study by warning of two populations in greatest need of more gameful work: “Alienated children in the suburbs and bored housewives in the homes <span class="italic">need</span> to experience flow. If they cannot get it, they will find substitutes in the form of escape.” This statement was eerily prophetic: today it is precisely these two demographic groups—suburban kids and women who are at home during the day—who spend the most time escaping into computer and video games.<a id="filepos95090" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos901411" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">4</sup><br class="calibre3"/>4</a> Clearly, we haven’t done enough to increase everyday flow.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Csíkszentmihályi was right about the need to reinvent reality to work more like a game. He was just too early. In 1975, the rest of the field of modern psychology was still largely focused on understanding mental illness and negative emotions, not optimal human experience. There wasn’t enough critical momentum among his peers to pick up the problem of everyday happiness. Meanwhile, the tools we had in 1975 for inventing and sharing new games with mass audiences were still in their infancy. <span class="italic">Pong</span>, the first commercial video game, was just three years old. The Atari home console was still two years away from being released. And only one major research book had been published on the psychology of gameplay: a 1971 book titled, appropriately, <span class="italic">The Study of Games</span>.<a id="filepos96041" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos901776" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">5</sup><br class="calibre3"/>5</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Today, however, we are in a very different position. Since Csíkszentmihályi’s breakthrough study, two crucial things have happened, making it suddenly much more practical to improve quality of life with games: the rise of positive psychology and the explosion of the computer and video game industry.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Positive psychology is the relatively new field of science that studies “human flourishing,” or how we achieve different kinds of happiness. For just over a decade now, positive-psychology researchers have been accumulating a formidable body of knowledge about how our brains and bodies work to help us achieve well-being and life satisfaction.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Meanwhile, the commercial game industry is putting all that knowledge to use. Game developers today understand that games become hits and make money in direct proportion to how much satisfaction they provide and how much positive emotion they provoke—in other words, how happy they make their players. As a result, game designers have been taught to relentlessly pursue happiness outcomes, including <span class="italic">flow</span>—and they’ve innovated a wide range of other happiness strategies along the way.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Happiness, of course, hasn’t always been the explicit goal of the game industry, and not all game developers today share it. Plenty of game developers today still think more about fun and amusement than well-being and life satisfaction. But since the rise of positive psychology, the creative leaders of the industry have increasingly focused on the emotional and psychological impact of their games. More and more, the directors and designers of major game studios are drawing directly on research findings from positive psychology to make better games. The game industry has even produced a number of scientific research labs expressly devoted to investigating the neurobiology of gameplay emotions.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">On the whole, a shift is clearly happening. As one journalist put it, the Microsoft game-testing lab “looks more like a psychological research institute than a game studio.”<a id="filepos98398" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos901993" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">6</sup><br class="calibre3"/>6</a> This is no accident. Game designers and developers are actively transforming what once was an intuitive art of optimizing human experience into an applied science. And as a result, they are becoming the most talented and powerful happiness engineers on the planet.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Today, these two historical trends—the science of happiness and the emotional evolution of the game industry—are intersecting. Thanks to positive psychologists, we know better than ever what kinds of experiences and activities really make us happy. And thanks to game developers, we have more and more powerful, and increasingly mobile, systems for providing intense, optimistic engagement and the emotional rewards we crave most.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">That gives us our second fix for reality:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">FIX # 2 : EMOTIONAL ACTIVATION</span></span></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Compared with games, reality is depressing. Games focus our energy, with relentless optimism, on something we’re good at and enjoy.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We are finally perfectly poised to harness the potential of games to make us happy and improve our everyday quality of life.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Let’s take a look at how we got here.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">IN 1983,</span> a jazz pianist and sociologist named David Sudnow published a video game memoir, the first of its kind. It was a 161-page chronicle of his efforts to master one of the original home video games: the Atari ping-pong-style game <span class="italic">Breakout</span>.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Sudnow wasn’t your stereotypical teen hanging out in an arcade. He was a forty-three-year-old professor with a successful side career in music and a full life by any objective measure. No one would have predicted that playing a video game would become more satisfying work for him than doing research or making music—least of all Sudnow himself. But to his great surprise, that’s exactly what happened. For three months, Sudnow played <span class="italic">Breakout</span> as if it were his full-time job: “Fifty hours, a good five hours a day for ten days, in the afternoon, the evening, at three o’clock in the morning.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What was so captivating about <span class="italic">Breakout</span>? It was basically single-player <span class="italic">Pong</span>: you’d rotate a joystick knob to move a flat paddle along the bottom of the screen and wait for a falling ball to hit the paddle. Move the paddle, wait for the ball; move the paddle, wait for the ball. Your goal was to aim the ball using the paddle to knock bricks out of a wall at the top of the screen.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">At first, this work was easy: your paddle was big, the ball fell slowly, and there were plenty of bricks to hit. But as you knocked out more and more bricks, the ball fell faster and bounced off the wall more erratically, and your paddle shrank to half its original size. It became increasingly difficult to keep the ball in play, and it took better and better aim to guide the ball toward the few remaining bricks. Once you missed five balls, the game was over.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As primitive a video game as it was, it nevertheless made for a perfect little voluntary workload. It had everything you’d want from an unnecessary obstacle: a clear goal (destroy a prison wall), arbitrary restrictions (use only a paddle and five balls), and instant feedback, both visual and audio (the bricks disappeared from the screen one at a time, always with a satisfying beep). The computer algorithms continuously adjusted the difficulty level to keep you playing at the very edge of your own abilities.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As Sudnow put it, “Here’s all the motivation you’d ever want . . . and the prize seemed to be just holding on.”<a id="filepos102731" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos902375" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">7</sup><br class="calibre3"/>7</a> The game completely sustained his attention, even when he wasn’t in front of the Atari console. “When I wasn’t at the TV, I was practicing the sequence in my imagination, walking down the street, sitting in a café twirling a salt shaker, looking up during dinner in a Japanese restaurant at a bamboo and rice paper trellis with <span class="italic">Breakout</span>-like rectangles on the ceiling . . . just waiting to get back to the game.”<a id="filepos103204" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos902685" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">8</sup><br class="calibre3"/>8</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The better he got at the game, the more he wanted to play, and the more he played, the better he got. Sudnow was so taken aback by the intensity of this continuous feedback loop, he felt compelled to write an entire book to understand it. It’s an extended, poetic meditation on the emotions of game-play. He says almost everything we need to know about the emotional power of early video games in just these two famous sentences:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">This was a whole different business, nothing like I’d ever known, like night and day.... Thirty seconds of play, and I’m on a whole new plane of being, all my synapses wailing.<a id="filepos104024" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos902817" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">9</sup><br class="calibre3"/>9</a></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What Sudnow describes is the extreme neurochemical activation that happens in our brains and bodies when we start to play a good computer or video game. He was intensely focused, highly motivated, creatively charged, and working at the very limits of his abilities. Immersion was almost instant. Flow was fast and virtually guaranteed.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">From zero to peak experience in thirty seconds flat—no wonder video games caught on. Never before in human history could this kind of optimal, emotional activation be accessed so cheaply, so reliably, so quickly.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In the past, the deepest experiences of flow had required years of practice to achieve, or extraordinary settings. When Csíkszentmihályi first wrote about it, he was studying <span class="italic">expert</span> players of chess, or basketball, or rock climbing, or partner dancing. Flow was typically the result of years, if not decades, of learning the structure of an activity and strengthening the required skills and abilities. Otherwise, it required being immersed in a truly spectacular and unusual context, like dancing in the crowded streets during carnival or skiing down an exceptionally challenging mountainside.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Flow wasn’t supposed to come easy. But, as Sudnow and millions of other early gamers discovered, video games made it possible to experience flow almost immediately. Video games took the traditional properties of potentially flow-inducing activities—a goal, obstacles, increasing challenge, and voluntary participation—and then used a combination of direct physical input (the joystick), flexible difficulty adjustment (the computer algorithms), and instant visual feedback (the video graphics) to tighten the feedback loop of games dramatically. And this faster, tighter feedback loop allowed for more reliable hits of the emotional reward fiero: each microlevel of difficulty you survived prompted a split-second emotional high.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The result was a much faster cycle of learning and reward, and ultimately a sense of perfect and powerful control over a “microworld” on the screen. As Sudnow described, “The joystick-button box feels like a genuine implement of action. <span class="italic">Bam, bam, bam,</span> got you . . . Please don’t miss, come on, do it, get that brick, easy does it, no surprises, now stay cool, don’t panic, take it in stride, get it now. Get that closure. Video-game action. You know when you’ve got it like you know your first drunk.”<a id="filepos106822" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos902948" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">10</sup><br class="calibre3"/>10</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It was this fast, reliable fix of flow and fiero that kept Sudnow and all the earliest gamers coming back for more. It’s no exaggeration to say that for many gamers, it probably felt like they had been waiting their whole lives for something like this: a seemingly free and endless supply of invigorating activity and every reason in the world to feel optimistic about their own abilities.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Then and now, faster, more reliable flow and fiero separates computer and video games from all the games that came before them. And that’s what makes Sudnow’s memoir of playing <span class="italic">Breakout</span> such an important historical artifact. He was the first to express what was so new and emotionally riveting about digital games, before the spectacular graphics, before the epic stories, and before the massively multiplayer worlds. Back then, <span class="italic">all</span> the emotional power of video games stemmed from the fact that they were interesting obstacles with better feedback and more adaptive challenges. As a result, they excelled at one thing and pretty much one thing only: provoking so much flow and fiero, they were nearly impossible to stop playing.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In fact, that was the whole point of these early video games: to keep playing as long as possible. One of the original and best-known Atari slogans was “Discover how far you can go.” It was a constant battle just to stay in the game, but that was also the primary satisfaction of playing. Flow and fiero are the original rewards of video gameplay, and by playing against the tireless machine, we could endlessly produce them for ourselves.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Well, almost endlessly.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">After three months, Sudnow finally exhausted his seemingly infinite source of flow. He played a perfect game of <span class="italic">Breakout</span>, destroying all the walls with just one ball. It was one of the biggest fiero moments of his life. But on that day, when he earned the highest possible score, his <span class="italic">Breakout</span> obsession ended. He had gone as far as flow and fiero could take him.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Fortunately for gamers, that’s not the end of the story.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Flow, as positive psychologists have documented, is only one part of the overall happiness picture. It was the first kind of happiness these psychologists studied, but the science has progressed significantly since then. As Corey Lee M. Keyes, a psychology professor at Emory University, explains, “Flow is considered <span class="italic">part</span> of the science of happiness but not all.... It is more of a temporal state than a trait or condition of human functioning. While there are studies on how to prolong it, flow is not seen as something that people can live within all the time.”<a id="filepos109885" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos903081" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">11</sup><br class="calibre3"/>11</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Flow is exhilarating in the moment. It makes us feel energized. A major flow experience can improve our mood for hours, or even days, afterward. But because it’s such a state of extreme engagement, it eventually uses up our physical and mental resources.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We can’t sustain flow indefinitely—as much as we might want to. That’s why, according to Keyes, human flourishing requires a more “continuous” approach to well-being. It can’t just be all flow, all the time. We have to find ways to enjoy the world and relish life even when we’re not operating at our peak human potential.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">This is true in games as well as in life.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">David Sudnow, it turns out, was so exhausted by the three months he spent suspended in nearly continuous <span class="italic">Breakout</span> flow that he subsequently stayed far away from video games for quite some time.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Too much flow can lead to happiness burnout. Meanwhile, too much fiero can lead to addiction—a word that Sudnow never once used in his memoir but which nevertheless inescapably leaps to mind. Fiero taps into some of our most primal hardwiring, and our emotional response can be extreme.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Recently, Allan Reiss, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at Stanford, led a team of researchers in a study of the neurochemistry of fiero in gamers. His laboratory captured MRIs of gamers’ brains while they were playing particularly challenging video games. The researchers observed exceptionally intense activation of the addiction circuitry of the brain when gamers experienced moments of triumph. And as a result, the researchers identified fiero as the most likely underlying cause of why some gamers feel “addicted” to their favorite games.<a id="filepos111956" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos903490" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">12</sup><br class="calibre3"/>12</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Gamer addiction is a subject the industry takes seriously—it’s a frequent topic at industry conferences and on game developer forums: what causes gamer addiction, and how can you help your players avoid it? This might at first seem surprising: doesn’t the industry want gamers to spend <span class="italic">more</span> time (and money) playing games, not less? And it’s true: more gaming by more people <span class="italic">is</span> the primary goal of the industry. But the industry wants to create <span class="italic">lifelong gamers</span>: people who can balance their favorite games with full and active lives. And so we have what is perhaps the central dilemma of the game industry over the past thirty years: how to enable gamers to play more without diminishing their real lives. The industry knows that gamers crave flow and fiero—and the more game developers give it to them, the more time and money gamers will spend on their favorite games. But beyond a certain playing threshold—for most gamers, it seems to be somewhere around twenty hours a week—they start to wonder if they’re perhaps missing out on real life.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Technology journalist Clive Thompson has a name for this phenomenon: <span class="italic">gamer regret</span>.<a id="filepos113282" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos903657" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">13</sup><br class="calibre3"/>13</a> And he’ll be the first to admit that he suffers from it as much as any other gamer. Thompson recalls checking his personal statistics one day—many games keep track of how many hours you’ve spent playing—and was shocked to see that he had clocked in thirty-six hours playing a single game in one week—as he described it, “a missing-time experience so vast one would normally require a UFO abduction to achieve it.” He found himself vacillating between pride in what he’d accomplished in the virtual game environment and wondering if all that hard work had really been worth it.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As Thompson writes: “The dirty secret of gamers is that we wrestle with this dilemma all the time. We’re often gripped by . . . a sudden, horrifying sense of emptiness when we muse on all the other things we could have done with our game time.” He admits: “The elation I feel when I finish a game is always slightly tinged with a worrisome sense of hollowness. Wouldn’t I have been better off doing something that was difficult and challenging <span class="italic">and</span> productive?”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">This internal conflict plays out in discussion forums all over Web. The twin questions “How much time do you spend playing games?” and “How much time is too much?” are ubiquitous in the gaming community.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As a partial solution to gamer regret, many of the most addictive online games have implemented a “fatigue system.” These systems are most commonly used in online games in South Korea and China, where the rates of online gaming for young men can average up to forty hours a week.<a id="filepos115039" href="dummy_split_069.html#filepos904094" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">14</sup><br class="calibre3"/>14</a> After three hours of consecutive online play, gamers receive 50 percent fewer rewards (and half the fiero) for accomplishing the same amount of work. After five hours, it becomes impossible to earn any rewards. In the United States, a softer touch is more commonly employed: <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span> players, for example, accumulate “resting bonuses” for every hour they spend <span class="italic">not</span> playing the game. When they log back in, their avatar can earn up to double rewards until it’s time to rest again.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But these measures are a stopgap at best. Trying to stop people from playing their favorite games will never work; motivated gamers hungry for flow and fiero will find a way around the restrictions and limitations. What’s needed instead is for games to go beyond flow and fiero, which make us happy in the moment, to provide a more lasting kind of emotional reward. We need games that make us happier even when we’re not playing. Only then will we find the right balance between playing our favorite games and making the most of our real lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Fortunately, that’s exactly what’s happening in the computer and video game market today. Games are increasingly teaching us the four secrets of how to make our own happiness—and they’re giving us the power to make it anytime, anywhere.</span></div>
