<div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="bold">CHAPTER ELEVEN</span></span></div><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">The Engagement Economy</span></span></div><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">O</span>n June 24, 2009, more than twenty thousand Britons joined forces online to investigate one of the biggest scandals in British parliament history—investigations that led to the resignations of dozens of parliament members and ultimately inspired sweeping political reform. How did these ordinary citizens make such a big difference? They did it by playing a game.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When the game began, the scandal had been brewing in the newspapers for weeks. According to leaked government documents, hundreds of members of parliament, or MPs, were regularly filing illegal expense claims, charging taxpayers up to tens of thousands of pounds annually for personal expenses completely unrelated to their political service. In a particularly inflammatory exposé, the <span class="italic">Telegraph</span> reported that Sir Peter Viggers, an MP from the southern coast of England, claimed £32,000 for personal gardening expenses, including £1,645 for a “floating duck island.”<a id="filepos535636" href="dummy_split_079.html#filepos963297" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">1</sup><br class="calibre3"/>1</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The public was outraged and demanded a full accounting of all MP expenses. In response, the government agreed to release the complete records for four years’ worth of MP claims. But in what was widely considered to be an attempt to hinder further investigation of the scandal, the government shared the data in the most unhelpful format possible: an unsorted collection of more than a million expense forms and receipts that had been scanned electronically. The files were saved as images, so that it was impossible to search or to cross-reference the claims. And much of the data had been redacted with big black blocks obscuring the detailed descriptions of items expensed. The data dump was dubbed “Blackoutgate” and called a “cover-up of massive proportions.”<a id="filepos536512" href="dummy_split_079.html#filepos963843" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">2</sup><br class="calibre3"/>2</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The editors at the <span class="italic">Guardian</span> knew it would take too long for their own reporters to sort through the entire data dump and make sense of it. So they decided to enlist the public’s direct help in uncovering whatever it was the authorities didn’t want uncovered. In other words, they “crowdsourced” the investigation.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The term <span class="bold1">crowdsourcing</span>, coined by technology journalist Jeff Howe in 2006, is shorthand for outsourcing a job to the crowd.<a id="filepos537134" href="dummy_split_079.html#filepos964289" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">3</sup><br class="calibre3"/>3</a> It means inviting a large group of people, usually on the Internet, to cooperatively tackle a big project. Wikipedia, the collaboratively authored online encyclopedia created by a crowd of more than 10 million unpaid (and often anonymous) writers and editors, is a prime example. Crowdsourcing is a way to do collectively, faster, better, and more cheaply what might otherwise be impossible for a single organization to do alone.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">With a million uncataloged government documents on its hands and no way of knowing which document could prove to be the smoking gun for which MP, the <span class="italic">Guardian</span> knew it needed all the crowd help it could get. So it decided to tap into the wisdom of the crowds—not with a wiki, however, but with a game.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">To develop the game, they turned to a young, but accomplished, London-based software developer named Simon Willison. His task: convert and condense all the scanned forms and expenses into 458,832 online documents, and set up a website where anyone could examine the public records for incriminating details. For the price of just a week’s worth of the development team’s time and a paltry fifty pounds to rent temporary servers to host the documents, the <span class="italic">Guardian</span> launched Investigate Your MP’s Expenses, the world’s first massively multiplayer investigative journalism project.</span></div>

</span></blockquote></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Just three days into the game, it was clear that the crowdsourcing effort was an unprecedented success. More than 20,000 players had already analyzed more than 170,000 electronic documents. Michael Andersen, a member of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University and an expert on Internet journalism, reported at the time: “Journalism has been crowdsourced before, but it’s the scale of the <span class="italic">Guardian</span>’s project—170,000 documents reviewed in the first 80 hours, thanks to a visitor participation rate of 56 percent—that’s breathtaking.”<a id="filepos541200" href="dummy_split_079.html#filepos964545" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">4</sup><br class="calibre3"/>4</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">A visitor participation rate measures the percentage of visitors who sign up and make a contribution to a network. A rate of 56 percent for <span class="italic">any</span> crowdsourced project was unheard of previously. (By comparison, roughly 4.6 percent of visitors to Wikipedia make a contribution to the online encyclopedia.)<a id="filepos541621" href="dummy_split_079.html#filepos965078" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">5</sup><br class="calibre3"/>5</a> It’s <span class="italic">especially</span> breathtaking considering the mind-numbingly tedious nature of the actual accounting work being performed.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">So what accounted for this unprecedented participation in a citizen journalism project? According to Willison, it all boiled down to rewarding participants in the right way: with the emotional rewards of a good game.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">“The number one lesson from this project: Make it feel like a game,” Willison said in an interview with the Nieman Journalism Lab. “Any time that you’re trying to get people to give you stuff, to do stuff for you, the most important thing is that people know that what they’re doing is having an effect. If you’re not giving people the ‘I rock’ vibe, you’re not getting people to stick around.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The “I rock” vibe is another way of talking about classic game rewards, such as having a clear sense of purpose, making an obvious impact, making continuous progress, enjoying a good chance of success, and experiencing plenty of fiero moments. The Investigate Your MP’s Expenses project featured all of these emotional rewards, in droves.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The game interface made it easy to take action and see your impact right away. When you examined a document, you had a panel of bright, shiny buttons to press depending on what you’d found. First, you’d decide what kind of document you were looking at: a claim form, proof (a receipt, invoice, or purchase order), a blank page, or “something we haven’t thought of.” Then you’d determine the level of interest of the document: “Interesting,” “Not interesting,” or “Investigate this! I want to know more.” When you’d made your selection, the button lit up, giving you a satisfying feeling of productivity, even if all you’d found was a blank page that wasn’t very interesting. And there was always a real hope of success: the promise of finding the next “duck pond” to keep you working quickly through the flow of documents.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">A real-time activity feed showed the names of players logged in recently and the actions they’d taken in the game. This feed made the site feel social. Even though you were not directly interacting with other players, you were copresent with them on the site and sharing the same experience. There was also a series of top contributor lists, for the previous forty-eight hours as well as for all time, to motivate both short-term and long-term participation. And to celebrate successful participation, as well as sheer volume of participation, there was also a “best individual discoveries” page that identified key findings from individual players. Some of these discoveries were over-the-top luxuries offensive to one’s sense of propriety: a £240 giraffe print or a £225 fountain pen, for example. Others were mathematical errors or inconsistencies suggesting individuals were reimbursed more than they were owed. As one player noted, “Bad math on page 29 of an invoice from MP Denis MacShane, who claimed £1,730 worth of reimbursement, when the sum of those items listed was only £1,480.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But perhaps most importantly, the website also featured a section labeled “Data: What we’ve learned from your work so far.” This page put the individual players’ efforts into a much bigger context—and guaranteed that contributors would see the real results of their efforts. Some of the key results of the game included these findings:<div class="calibre28"><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• On average, each MP expensed <span class="italic">twice</span> his or her annual salary, or more than £140,000 in expenses on top of a £60,675 salary.</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• The total cost to taxpayers of personal items expensed by MPs is £88 million annually.</span></blockquote></div></div><div class="calibre8"> </div></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And the game detailed:<div class="calibre28"><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• The number of receipts and papers filed by each MP, ranging between 40 and 2,000 </span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• The total expense spending by party and by category (kitchen, garden, TV, food, etc.)</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• Online maps comparing travel expenses filed with actual distance from the House of Commons in London to the MPs’ home districts, making it easy to spot MPs grossly overcharging for travel (for example, MPs from nearby districts who filed £21,534 versus £4,418, or £10,105 versus £1,680)</span></blockquote></div></div><div class="calibre8"> </div></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Bringing these numbers to light helped clarify the true extent of the crisis: a far more pervasive culture of extravagant personal reimbursement than originally suspected.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">So what did the players accomplish? Real political results. At least twenty-eight MPs resigned or declared their intention to do so at the end of their term, and by early 2010 criminal proceedings against four MPs investigated by the players were under way. New expense codes are being written, and old codes are being enforced more vigorously. Most concretely, hundreds of MPs were ordered to repay a total of £1.12 million.<a id="filepos547277" href="dummy_split_079.html#filepos965426" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">6</sup><br class="calibre3"/>6</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s not all the doing of the <span class="italic">Guardian</span>’s gamers, of course. But without a doubt, the game played a crucial role. The citizen journalists helped put significant political pressure on the British government by keeping the scandal in the news. The longer the game continued, the more public momentum built to force major policy reform.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Investigate Your MP’s Expenses enabled tens of thousands of citizens to participate directly in a new kind of political reform movement. Instead of just clamoring for change, they put their time and effort into creating evidence that change was needed. Crucially, the crowd of gamers did all of this important work faster than any individual organization could have, and they did it for free—lowering the costs of investigative journalism and speeding up the democratic reform process.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Not all crowdsourcing projects are so successful. Working together on extreme scales is easier said than done. You can’t crowdsource without a crowd—and it turns out that actively engaged crowds can be hard to come by.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In 2008, New York University professor and Internet researcher Clay Shirky sat down with IBM researcher Martin Wattenberg and tried to work out exactly how much human effort has gone into making Wikipedia. They looked at the total number of articles and edits, as well as the average article length and average time per edit. They factored in all of the reading time required to find knowledge gaps and spot errors, and all of the hours of programming and ongoing community management required to make those edits hang together coherently. After a lot of clever math, they worked out the following estimate:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">If you take Wikipedia as a kind of unit, all of Wikipedia, the whole project—every page, every edit, every talk page, every line of code, in every language that Wikipedia exists in—that represents something like the accumulation of 100 million hours of human thought.... It’s a back-of-the-envelope calculation, but it’s the right order of magnitude, about 100 million hours of thought.<a id="filepos549705" href="dummy_split_079.html#filepos965986" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">7</sup><br class="calibre3"/>7</a></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">On one hand, that’s no trivial effort. It’s the equivalent of rounding up a million people and convincing them to spend a hundred hours each contributing to Wikipedia, for free. Put another way: it’s like persuading ten thousand people to dedicate five full-time work years to the Wikipedia project. That’s a <span class="italic">lot</span> of effort to ask a <span class="italic">lot</span> of people to make, for no extrinsic reward, on behalf of someone else’s vision.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">On the other hand, given that there are 1.7 billion Internet users on the planet and twenty-four hours in a day, it really shouldn’t be that hard to successfully pull off lots of projects on the scale of Wikipedia.<a id="filepos550585" href="dummy_split_079.html#filepos966359" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">8</sup><br class="calibre3"/>8</a> Hypothetically, if we could provide the right motivation, we should be able to complete one hundred Wikipedia-size projects <span class="italic">every single day—</span>if we could convince all 1.7 billion Internet users to spend most of their free time voluntarily contributing to crowdsourced projects.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Maybe that’s unrealistic. More reasonably, if we could convince every Internet user to volunteer just one single hour a week, we could accomplish a great deal. Collectively, we would be able to complete nearly <span class="italic">twenty</span> Wikipedia-size projects <span class="italic">every single week</span>.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Which really makes you wonder: with so much potential, why aren’t there even more Wikipedia-scale projects out there?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The truth is, the Internet is littered with underperforming, barely populated, or completely abandoned collaboration spaces: wikis that have no contributors, discussion forums with no comments, open-source projects with no active users, social networks with barely a few members, and Facebook groups with plenty of members but few who ever do anything after joining. According to Shirky, more than half of all collaborative projects online fail to achieve the minimum number of participants necessary to even begin working on their goal, let alone achieve it.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s not for a lack of time spent on the Internet. It’s just incredibly difficult to achieve the necessary critical mass of participation on any given serious project.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">For one thing, some participatory networks are more rewarding than others—and the most readily rewarding networks aren’t, as a rule, the ones doing serious work. Online games and “fun” social networks like Facebook provide the steadiest stream of intrinsic rewards. They’re <span class="italic">autotelic</span> spaces—spaces we visit for the pure enjoyment of it. Their primary purpose is to be rewarding, not to solve a problem or get work done. Unlike serious projects, they are engineered first and foremost to engage and satisfy our emotional cravings. And as a result, <span class="italic">they</span> are the projects that are absorbing the vast majority of our online <span class="bold1">participation bandwidth</span>—our individual and collective capacity to contribute to one or more participatory networks.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">A second and more pressing problem is the fact that, across serious crowd projects, our participation resources are increasingly being spread too thin.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In the past month, I’ve been invited to join exactly forty-three Facebook groups. I’ve been asked to help edit fifteen wikis and contribute to nearly twenty Google Docs. And I’ve been (unsuccessfully) recruited for nearly twenty other assorted collective intelligence projects, each one requesting me to spend valuable online time voting, ranking, judging, editing, sorting, labeling, approving, commenting, translating, predicting, contributing, or otherwise participating in someone else’s idea of a worthy mission. I may be an extreme example—I’m a highly networked individual with many personal contacts doing interesting work online. But I’m certainly not alone in feeling overwhelmed by participation requests. Increasingly, I hear the same complaint from friends, colleagues, and clients: there are simply too many demands, from too many people, on our online engagement.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I call it “participation spam.” It’s the increasingly unsolicited requests we receive on a daily basis to participate in someone else’s group. If you’re not getting participation-spammed yet, you will—and soon.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">By my own back-of-the-envelope estimate, there are currently more than 200 million public requests for crowd participation on the Internet, across thousands of different networks, ranging from citizen journalism, citizen science, and open government to peer-to-peer advice, social networking, and open innovation. This estimate factors in, for example, more than 1 million public social networks created on Ning, more than 100,000 wikis on Wikia, more than 100,000 crowdsourcing projects on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, at least 20,000 videos awaiting transcription and translation on DotSUB, as well as myriad smaller clusters of open collaboration, such as the more than 3,300 public “idea spaces” for proposing and developing innovative ideas on IBM Lotus’ IdeaJam and more than 14,000 on Dell’s IdeaStorm.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">With 1.7 billion people on the Internet, that works out to about 8.5 people per crowd.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">That’s a very small crowd.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s certainly not a big enough crowd to build a resource on the scale of Wikipedia.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">This problem is likely going to get worse before it gets better. As it becomes easier and cheaper to launch a participation network, it will likely become equally difficult to sustain it. There are only so many potential participants on the Internet. And as long as participation is designed as an active process requiring some mental effort, there are only so many units of engagement, or mental hours, each participant can reasonably expend in a given hour, day, week, or month.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">To effectively harness the wisdom of the crowds, and to successfully leverage the participation of the many, organizations will need to become effective players in an emerging <span class="bold1">engagement economy</span>. In the economy of engagement, it is less and less important to compete for attention and more and more important to compete for things like brain cycles and interactive bandwidth. Crowd-dependent projects must figure out how to capture the mental energy and the active effort it takes to make individual contributions to a larger whole. For this reason, the overall crowdsourcing culture likely will not be immune from “the tragedy of the commons”—the crisis that occurs when individuals selfishly exhaust a collective resource. Collaboration projects will have to compete for crowd resources as online communities seek to grab as many mental hours as possible from their members. These gains will likely come at the expense of other projects still striving to secure their own passionate community. Collaboration may be the signature modus operandi of these projects, but the competition for participants will be fierce and not all projects will thrive.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As we consider these challenges, some of the key questions for the emerging engagement economy start to arise: Who will do all of the participating necessary to make the seemingly endless flow of participatory projects a success? Are there enough willing quality collaborators in the world to do it? How do you draw a big and passionate enough crowd to tackle extreme-scale goals? And what will motivate the crowds who do show up to stick around long enough to collectively create something of value?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We have to face facts. It’s very difficult to motivate large numbers of people to come together at the same time and to contribute any significant amount of energy—let alone their very best effort—to a collaborative project. Most big crowd projects today fail: they fail to attract a crowd, or they fail to give the crowd the right kind of work, or they fail to reward the crowd well enough to keep it participating over the long haul.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But it’s not hopeless. As both Wikipedia and Investigate Your MP’s Expenses show, there are significant crowdsourcing projects succeeding. And they all have one important thing in common: they’re structured like a good multiplayer game.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The most active contributors to Wikipedia, the world’s most successful crowdsourced project, already know this. In fact, they’ve created a special project to detail all the ways in which Wikipedia is like a game.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As more than fifty leading Wikipedia contributors have helped explain, “One theory that explains the addictive quality of Wikipedia and its tendency to produce Wikipediholics (people who are addicted to editing Wikipedia articles) is that Wikipedia is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.” And, according to the happily addicted Wikipedians, it works like a good MMORPG in three key ways.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">First, Wikipedia is a <span class="bold1">good game world</span>. Its extreme scale inspires our sense of awe and wonder, while its sprawling navigation encourages curiosity, exploration, and collaboration. Here’s exactly how the Wikipedians described it in one recent version of the constantly changing wiki page:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Wikipedia has an immersive game world with over 10.7 million <span class="italic">players</span> (registered contributors, or “Wikipedians”) and over 3.06 million <span class="italic">unique locations</span> (Wikipedia articles), including 137,356 undiscovered <span class="italic">secret areas</span> (“lonely pages,” or articles that aren’t linked to any other articles and therefore can’t be found by browsing), 7,500 completely explored <span class="italic">dungeons</span> (“good articles,” or exhaustively written articles with excellent citations and evidence provided), and 2,700 <span class="italic">boss levels</span> (“featured articles,” or the top-ranking articles as judged by accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and style).<a id="filepos560667" href="dummy_split_079.html#filepos966666" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">9</sup><br class="calibre3"/>9</a></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In other words, Wikipedia, like all of the most engaging multiplayer game worlds, is an <span class="italic">epic built environment</span>. It invites participants to explore, act, and spend large amounts of time there.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Second, Wikipedia has <span class="bold1">good game mechanics</span>. Player action has direct and clear results: edits appear instantly on the site, giving users a powerful sense of control over the environment. This instant impact creates optimism and a strong sense of self-efficacy. It features unlimited work opportunities, of escalating difficulty. As the Wikipedians describe it, “Players can take on <span class="italic">quests</span> (WikiProjects, efforts to organize many articles into a single, larger article), fight <span class="italic">boss-level battles</span> (featured articles that are held to higher standards than ordinary articles), and enter <span class="italic">battle arenas</span> (interventions against article vandalism).” It also has a personal feedback system that helps Wikipedians feel like they are improving and making personal progress as they contribute. “Players can accumulate <span class="italic">experience points</span> (edit count), allowing them to advance to higher <span class="italic">levels</span> (lists of top-ranking Wikipedians by number of edits).”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Meanwhile, like all good games, there is significant friction to achieving the goal. It’s not just about making good edits. The game also has a clearly defined enemy to defeat: vandals who make unhelpful edits to the site. “Edit wars” are said to break out between competing contributors with different points of view, and players have developed collaboration techniques and combat tools to deal with these high-level challenges. As an edit war escalates, more and more editors are called to join the conversation and work toward a solution.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Which leads to the third key aspect of Wikipedia’s good gameness: it has <span class="bold1">good game community</span>. Good game community requires two things: plenty of positive social interaction and a meaningful context for collective effort. Wikipedia has both. As Wikipedians describe it:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Every <span class="italic">unique location</span> (article) in the <span class="italic">game world</span> (encyclopedia) has a <span class="italic">tavern</span> (“talk page,” or discussion forum) where players have the opportunity to interact with any other player in real time. Players often become friends with other players, and some have even arranged to <span class="italic">meet in real life</span> (“meetups,” or face-to-face social gatherings for frequent Wikipedia contributors).</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The talk pages encourage both sociable competition (arguing over recent edits) and collaboration (improving and organizing existing articles). This kind of persistent positive social interaction around common goals builds trust and strong bonds—which naturally extends to face-to-face relationships. Indeed, roughly a hundred Wikipedia meetups occur a year, everywhere from Reykjavik, Cape Town, Munich, and Buenos Aires to Perth, Kyoto, Jakarta, and Nashville.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Also crucial to good community is the sense of meaning created by belonging and contributing to such an epic project. Wikipedia members are always working toward extreme-scale goals—aiming first for 100,000 articles, then 1 million, then 2 million, and then 3 million—as well as celebrating traffic milestones—the date Wikipedia first broke into the top 500 websites, the top 100, the top 20, and, most recently, the top 10. And they are constantly immersed in awe-inspiring project statistics, greeted on the site’s home page with a list of the more than 270 different language versions of Wikipedia and growing.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Wikipedians explicitly credit the good gameness of the system—its compelling game world, satisfying game mechanics, and inspiring game community—for their dedicated long-term participation. To conclude their analysis of Wikipedia as an MMORPG: “People tend to play a given MMORPG for six to eighteen months at a high level of involvement; a similar pattern (of “Wikibreaking,” or separating from the site to attend to other projects) has been noted in hard-core Wikipedia players.”<a id="filepos565316" href="dummy_split_079.html#filepos966994" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">10</sup><br class="calibre3"/>10</a> In other words, most games eventually get boring—we exhaust their challenges and creative possibilities—and Wikipedia is no different. While there are some perpetual Wikipedians, most members are of service to the site for a limited period of time, after which they’re likely to move on to a new system that offers new content and fresher challenges.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The “Wikipedia is an MMORPG” project is particularly compelling precisely because so much valuable participation effort is being spent in MMORPG environments.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Take <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span>, for example—the most successful MMORPG ever. Currently, with more than 11.5 million subscribers, each averaging between sixteen and twenty-two hours a week playing the game, that’s 210 million participation hours spent weekly on just a single MMORPG. And the number of <span class="italic">WoW</span> subscribers is almost exactly the same as the number of registered contributors to Wikipedia.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Based on Clay Shirky’s estimate that all of Wikipedia took 100 million hours to create, the <span class="italic">WoW</span> community alone could conceivably create a new Wikipedia every three and a half days.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But let’s say, for argument’s sake, that most people who play <span class="italic">WoW</span> wouldn’t be even remotely interested in any kind of collective intelligence project. There are still more than 65,000 <span class="italic">WoW</span> players who are registered contributors to WoWWiki, currently the world’s second largest wiki after Wikipedia. Even if you managed to successfully engage only that group, it would still take them only <span class="italic">two months</span> of channeling their usual <span class="italic">WoW</span> playing time to a crowdsourcing project to collectively create a resource on the scale of Wikipedia. By comparison, Wikipedia took <span class="italic">eight years</span> to collect 100 million hours of cognitive effort.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When I first started looking at these numbers, I had two insights.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">First, gamers are an extremely valuable—and largely untapped—source of participation bandwidth. Whoever figures out how to effectively engage them first for real work is going to reap enormous benefits. (And clearly, the Guardian’s Investigate Your MP’s Expenses represents one of the first organizations to do just that.)</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Second, crowdsourcing projects—if they have any hope of capturing enough participation bandwidth to achieve truly ambitious goals—must be intentionally designed to offer the same kinds of intrinsic rewards we get from good games. Increasingly, I’m convinced that this is the only way to dramatically increase our total available participation bandwidth. If everyone spent as much time actively engaged in good, hard work as gamers do, we wouldn’t be competing for scarce crowd resources. We’d have massively more mental hours to pour into important collective efforts.</span></div>
