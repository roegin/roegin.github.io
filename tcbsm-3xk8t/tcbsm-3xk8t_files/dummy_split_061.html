<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">Who we need:</span> SEHIs who believe that a long-term mind-set and a playful approach to life can help us to become a better people, make better choices about our actions and their consequences, potentially avoid the kind of supercrises we are facing here in 2019, and give every person on the planet the opportunity to create a meaningful legacy to the human race.</span></div>

</span></blockquote></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">A thousand-year game, combining financial and nonfinancial investment of our most important resources—how exactly would such a game work?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">During the Superstruct experiment, we brainstormed different ideas, focusing largely on structure rather than theme, story, or content. For example, we imagined the entire world setting aside one day each year to play the game, as a kind of global holiday. Of course, like all good games, participation would be optional. But the supergoal of the game would be, by the end of one thousand years, to engage virtually 100 percent of the human population in playing.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Enthusiastic players could spend as much time as they wanted throughout the year preparing for the global game day. Casual players could simply show up to a game site (online or in the real world) and take part for a few minutes, a few hours, or even all twenty-four hours in the year’s game day.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">That entire global game day would represent one “move” in the game. And perhaps, we imagined, The Long Game would be played in rounds of fifty moves each. So if you played The Long Game your entire life, you would hope to be able to experience a complete round at least once, if not twice.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Every tenth move would represent a bigger and more significant occasion, to provide a kind of momentous leveling-up occasion each decade. Each twenty-fifth and each fiftieth move, the halfway mark and the end of each round, would be an even more momentous occasion—each time the culmination of a quarter century of gamers’ efforts.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What specifically would making a move in the game entail? We envisioned a combination of events. Social rituals and circle games to build common ground. Crowdsourced challenges and collective feats—in the style of a traditional barn raising—to focus the world’s energy and attention on a single problem and a single transformation. And forecasting exercises to create shared momentum for the future, and to collectively decide the challenges and themes of the next year’s set of games.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">No one would ever live to see both the start and the end of the game, of course—not even close. But the game would be a <span class="italic">throughline</span> for humanity, a tangible connection between our actions today and the world our descendants inherit tomorrow. It would create a sense of awe and wonder, inspiring us to imagine how this massively scaled adventure we are a part of could play out, and to make as meaningful an impact in the game as possible, so we can make a difference in our lifetime that lasts for many lifetimes more.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s not that hard to imagine people spending their entire lives playing a single game. Many <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span> gamers have now been playing their favorite game for nearly an entire decade already; so has the <span class="italic">Halo</span> community. Countless among us spend a lifetime mastering a game like chess, poker, or golf.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And we already have a historical precedent for societies successfully keeping a game tradition alive for an entire millennium—the ancient Greeks ran their Olympiad every four years without interruption for roughly one thousand years.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The Long Game doesn’t exist yet. But it just might be what the world needs now.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Aspiring to engage every single human being on the planet in a single game isn’t an arbitrary goal. To accomplish that goal would mean transforming the planet and global society in key ways.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It would require every single village in the world to have some level of access to the Internet, via personal computers or mobile phones, so that truly everyone could contribute to the game. Universal Internet access is in its own right a significant and worthy goal. Today, roughly one in four people on the planet has reliable, daily Internet access.<a id="filepos839686" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos991641" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">30</sup><br class="calibre3"/>30</a> When every family in the remote villages of Africa, or in what today are the slums of India, or throughout Nicaragua—when they and everyone else in the world has access to The Long Game, that will mean greater access to education, culture, and economic opportunity as well.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Furthermore, for every person on the planet to play the same game, there would need to be free communications across all geopolitical borders. What would it take before every citizen of North Korea, for example, could play The Long Game?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The Long Game, if we have the will to design it, and if we create the means for universal participation, could be the good game that humanity plays to collectively take us to the next level, achieving a new scale of cooperation, coordination, and cocreation. As Kathi Vian urged in her introduction to the Superstruct Ten-Year Forecast:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Zoom out. Look at the coming decade from the perspective of millennia of change. Focus on the progress of the universe from the breakthrough structures of the atom to the living cell, the biota, the community of nations, the global economy. This is how the future will be new, by continuing the incredible experiment of reorganization for greater complexity, by creating the next astonishing structural forms in this long evolutionary path.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It seems clear to me that games are the most likely candidate to serve as the next great breakthrough structure for life on earth.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">There’s no guarantee, of course, that evolution will continue along any given path, other than the path of improved survivability in a given environment. But all of the historic evidence seems to suggest that collaboration improves human survivability, and will continue to do so, as long as we can innovate new ways of working together.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">First humans invented language. Then farming, and cities; trade and democratic forms of government and the Internet—all ways of supporting human life and collaboration at bigger and more complex scales.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We have been playing good games for nearly as long as we have been human. It is now time to play them on extreme scales.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Together, we can tackle what may be the most worthwhile, most epic obstacle of all: a whole-planetary mission, to use games to raise global quality of life, to prepare ourselves for the future, and to sustain our earth for the next millennium and beyond.</span></div>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_62"></div>
