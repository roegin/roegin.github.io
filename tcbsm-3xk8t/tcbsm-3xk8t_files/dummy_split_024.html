<span class="bold">Epic Environments—Or How to Build a Better Place</span>
</span></span><br class="calibre13"/>
史诗般的环境ーー或如何建造一个更美好的地方
</h1><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">An epic environment is a space that, by virtue of its extreme scale, provokes a profound sense of awe and wonder.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">There are plenty of natural epic environments in the world: Mount Everest, the Grand Canyon, Victoria Falls, the Great Barrier Reef, for example. These spaces humble us; they remind us of the power and grandeur of nature, and make us feel small by comparison.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">A <span class="italic">built</span> epic environment is different: it’s not the work of nature, but rather a feat of design and engineering. It’s a <span class="italic">human</span> accomplishment. And that makes it both humbling and empowering at the same time. It makes us feel smaller as individuals, but it also makes us feel capable of much bigger things, together. That’s because a built epic environment—like the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, or Machu Picchu—is the result of extreme-scale collaboration. It’s proof of the extraordinary scale of things humans can accomplish together.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">Halo 3</span> is, without a doubt, such an environment.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The game consists of thirty-four different playing environments spanning more than two hundred thousand light-years of virtual space. From one level to the next, you might find yourself traveling from the crowded market city of Voi, Kenya, to the Ark, a desert far, far beyond the limits of our own Milky Way galaxy.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s not just how big the <span class="italic">Halo</span> playing field is; it’s also how diverse and carefully rendered the environments are. As Sam Leith observes, “The building of a game like <span class="italic">Halo 3</span> is a work of electronic engineering comparable in scale to the building of a medieval cathedral.” It took Bungie three years to craft this gaming cathedral, with a team of more than 250 artists, designers, writers, programmers, and engineers collaborating together. “You get a sense of the scale and intricacy of the task,” Leith continues, “by considering the sound effects alone: The game contains 54,000 pieces of audio and 40,000 lines of dialogue. There are 2,700 different noises for footsteps alone, depending on whose foot is stepping on what.”<a id="filepos268562" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos940343" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">22</sup><br class="calibre3"/>22</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And that’s what players are appreciating when they get goose bumps from <span class="italic">Halo</span>: the unprecedented achievement it represents as a work of computer design and engineering. Gamers aren’t so much in awe of the environment itself as they are in awe of the work and dedication and vision required to create it. In this regard, <span class="italic">Halo</span> players join a long tradition in human culture of feeling awe, wonder, and gratitude toward the builders of epic environments.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">THE VERY FIRST</span> epic environments were constructed more than eleven thousand years ago, during the Neolithic period, or the New Stone Age. In other words, six thousand years before humans first used the written word, they were already building physical spaces to inspire awe and cooperation.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The world’s oldest known example of an epic built environment is the Gobekli Tepe. Discovered less than two decades ago in southeastern Turkey, it’s believed to predate Stonehenge by a staggering six thousand years. It’s a twenty-five-acre arrangement of at least twenty stone circles, between ten and thirty meters in diameter each, made from monolithic pillars three meters high.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In comparison with other stone houses, tombs, and temples from the same period and location, this building was constructed on an extreme scale: it was much, <span class="italic">much</span> bigger, taller, and more formidable in its design than anything archaeologists had seen before at the time of its discovery. One archaeologist on the scene described it as “a place of worship on an unprecedented scale—humanity’s first ‘cathedral on a hill.’”<a id="filepos270456" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos940502" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">23</sup><br class="calibre3"/>23</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And it wasn’t just the scale of the building—it was its particular winding design. The Gobekli Tepe features an intricate series of passageways that would lead visitors through the dark to a cross-shaped inner sanctum, almost like a labyrinth. This particular architecture seems designed intentionally to trigger interest and curiosity, alongside a kind of trembling wonder. What would be around the next corner? Where would the path take them? They would need to hold on to other visitors for support, feeling their way through the darkness.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Crucially, the Gobekli Tepe wasn’t an isolated example. As researchers have discovered since, epic stone cathedrals were common across the Neolithic landscape. Most recently, in August 2009, archaeologists working in northern Scotland unearthed the ruins of a 5,330-square-foot stone structure with twenty-foot ceilings and sixteen-foot-thick walls, also of a labyrinthine design, and also dating back to the New Stone Age.<a id="filepos271594" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos940896" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">24</sup><br class="calibre3"/>24</a> “A building of this scale and complexity was here to amaze, to create a sense of awe in the people who saw this place,” Nick Card, director of the archaeological dig, said to reporters when the ancient cathedral was first unearthed.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In the wake of unearthing these types of structures all over the planet, archaeologists have recently proposed a startling theory: that these stone cathedrals served an important purpose in the evolution of human civilization. They actually inspired and enabled human society to become dramatically more cooperative, completely reinventing civilization as it once existed. In an in-depth report in <span class="italic">Smithsonian</span> magazine on these Neolithic cathedrals, Andrew Curry wrote:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Scholars have long believed that only after people learned to farm and live in settled communities did they have the time, organization and resources to construct temples and support complicated social structures. But . . . [perhaps] it was the other way around: the extensive, coordinated effort to build the monoliths literally laid the groundwork for the development of complex societies.<a id="filepos272911" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos941295" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">25</sup><br class="calibre3"/>25</a></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In fact, as Curry quotes one scientist in his article, “You can make a good case these constructs are the real origin of complex Neolithic societies.”<a id="filepos273240" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos941441" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">26</sup><br class="calibre3"/>26</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">No wonder epic environments inspire gamers today to collective efforts. They have been inspiring humans to work together to do amazing things for eleven thousand years and counting.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">SO VIDEO GAMES</span> didn’t invent epic environment design. They inherited the tradition from some of our earliest ancestors. But they <span class="italic">are</span> making epic environments remarkably more accessible, to vastly more people, on a daily basis.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Archaeologists say that worshippers would have traveled more than a hundred miles by foot to visit the Gobekli Tepe, and they may have visited it just once in a lifetime. Today, however, it’s easy to immerse ourselves in epic environments whenever we want. Instead of traveling great distances for a single encounter with a physical cathedral, we can instantly transport ourselves there from anywhere in the world, simply by loading up a blockbuster video game.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Our experience of these epic game environments isn’t physical, but it is real in one crucial sense. The engineering of the virtual environment represents, today, a collaborative feat on an extreme scale. It takes an extraordinary collective and coordinated effort to create these virtual worlds—years of full-time, painstaking work by hundreds of artists and programmers—and the first time a gamer enters one of these massive environments, they are experiencing real awe at the ability of ordinary people, when they band together, to create extraordinary spaces.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Meanwhile, video game developers have evolved the art of epic built environments in another key way: they have added a layer of awe-inspiring sound.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The sound track isn’t just part of the background of playing; it’s a major component of the gaming experience—particularly in the case of <span class="italic">Halo</span> and its famously spine-tingling score. Tracks on the <span class="italic">Halo 3</span> sound track have names like “Honorable Intentions,” “This Is the Hour,” and “Never Forget.” Perhaps my favorite track is called simply “Ambient Wonder,” a name that perfectly sums up the purpose of an epic environment: to create a space that completely absorbs and envelops the player in a sense of awe and wonder.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">Halo</span>’s audio director, Martin O’Donnell, describes his goal in creating the score: “The music should give a feeling of importance, weight, and sense of the ‘ancient’ to the visuals of <span class="italic">Halo</span>.” The score includes Gregorian chanting, a string orchestra, percussion, and Qawwali vocals, a Sufi devotional style of music intended to produce an ecstatic state in the listener.<a id="filepos276248" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos941570" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">27</sup><br class="calibre3"/>27</a> These are timeless musical techniques for provoking our bodies’ epic emotions—and video games increasingly make use of them. As one <span class="italic">Halo</span> player explains, “A great video game will make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. Goose pimples will erupt. That tingly sensation overtakes your gut. It happens to me whenever I hear the <span class="italic">Halo</span> sound track.”<a id="filepos276670" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos942267" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">28</sup><br class="calibre3"/>28</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">SO WHAT DO</span> all of these extreme visual and audio environments add up to? Epic projects: collaborative efforts to tell stories and accomplish missions at extreme scales.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Epic environments inspire us to undertake epic projects, because they are a tangible demonstration of what is humanly possible when we all work together. Indeed, they <span class="italic">expand</span> our notion of what is humanly possible. And that’s why exploring an epic environment like <span class="italic">Halo 3</span> inspires the kind of emotions that lead to large-scale cooperation, an epic achievement in and of itself.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Games journalist Margaret Robertson reflects, “<span class="italic">Halo</span> has always been a place where I feel good. I don’t mean that in a James Brown sense. I mean it’s a place where I feel virtuous.... [It] engenders a sense of honour and duty which actually make you feel like a better person.... What’s the point of going to a better place if you aren’t going to be a better person?”<a id="filepos277874" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos942596" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">29</sup><br class="calibre3"/>29</a></span></div>
