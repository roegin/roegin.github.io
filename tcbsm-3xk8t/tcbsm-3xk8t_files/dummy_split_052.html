<div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Collaboration Superpowers</span></span></div><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">B</span>y the age of twenty-one, the average young American has spent somewhere between two and three thousand hours reading books—and more than <span class="italic">ten thousand</span> hours playing computer and video games.<a id="filepos650637" href="dummy_split_081.html#filepos979156" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">1</sup><br class="calibre3"/>1</a> With each year after 1980 you’re born, these statistics are increasingly likely to be true.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">To put that number in perspective, ten thousand hours is almost exactly the same amount of time an average American student spends in the classroom from the moment they start fifth grade all the way through high school graduation—if they have perfect attendance. In other words, as much time as they spend learning reading, writing, math, science, history, government, geography, foreign languages, art, physical education, and so on over the course of their middle school and high school careers they spend teaching themselves (and each other) to play computer and video games. And unlike their formal education, which diffuses their attention across myriad different subjects and skills, every single gaming hour is concentrated on improving at just one thing: becoming a better gamer.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">With ten thousand hours under their belts by age twenty-one, most of these young people will be more than just good gamers. They’ll be <span class="italic">exceptionally</span> good gamers.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">That’s because ten thousand hours of practice before the age of twenty-one, according to at least one theory, is the number one predictor of extraordinary success later in life.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Malcolm Gladwell first proposed the ten-thousand-hour theory in his best-selling book <span class="italic">Outliers: The Story of Success</span>. In <span class="italic">Outliers</span>, Gladwell reports on the life stories of high-achieving individuals, from violin virtuosos to all-star hockey players to Bill Gates, and he finds that they all have one autobiographical fact in common. By the age of twenty, the top performers in any given field had each accumulated at least ten thousand hours of practice at the one thing that eventually made them superstars. Meanwhile, the runnersup—the second tier of successful, but not extraordinarily successful, musicians, athletes, technologists, businesspeople, and so on—had on average eight thousand or fewer practice hours each.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Natural talent matters, of course, but not as much as practice and preparation. And, according to Gladwell, ten thousand hours of practice and preparation appears to be the crucial threshold, marking the difference between simply being good at something and becoming extraordinary at it.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">This means that we are well on our way to creating an <span class="italic">entire generation</span> of virtuoso gamers. Every young person who achieves ten thousand hours of gaming practice will be capable of extraordinary success in gaming environments later in life.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s potentially an unprecedented human resource: hundreds of millions of people worldwide who are going to be exceptionally good at the same thing—whatever it is games make us good at.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Which brings us to the million-dollar question for the future: What, exactly, are gamers getting good at?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I’ve been researching that question for nearly a decade, first as a PhD student at the University of California at Berkeley and later as the director of game research and development at the Institute for the Future. Over the years, it has become increasingly clear to me that gamers—especially online gamers—are exceptionally skilled at one important thing: collaboration. In fact, I believe online gamers are among the most collaborative people on earth.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">Collaboration</span> is a special way of working together. It requires three distinct kinds of concerted effort: <span class="italic">cooperating</span> (acting purposefully toward a common goal), <span class="italic">coordinating</span> (synchronizing efforts and sharing resources), and <span class="italic">cocreating</span> (producing a novel outcome together). This third element, cocreation, is what sets collaboration apart from other collective efforts: it is a fundamentally <span class="italic">generative</span> act. Collaboration isn’t just about achieving a goal or joining forces; it’s about creating something together that it would be impossible to create alone.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">You can collaborate to create just about anything: a group experience, a knowledge resource, a work of art. Increasingly, gamers are collaborating to create all of these outcomes. In fact, they’re collaborating even when they’re competing against each other to win. More and more, gamers are collaborating even when they’re playing alone.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It seems counterintuitive: how can you collaborate with someone when you’re actively opposing them? Or even harder to imagine: how on earth can you collaborate all by yourself? But in fact, online gamers are increasingly doing both, thanks to two factors: the fundamentally collaborative aspects of playing any good game, and new game technologies and design patterns that support entirely new ways of working together.</span></div>
