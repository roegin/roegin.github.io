<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Sometimes we want company, but we don’t want to actively interact with anybody. That’s where the idea of playing alone together comes in.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">MMOs are famous for their collaborative quests and group raids. But it turns out that a majority of players prefer to play the game solo. An eight-month study of more than 150,000 <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span> players discovered that players were spending on average 70 percent of their time pursuing individual missions, barely interacting with other players.<a id="filepos228476" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos930483" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">30</sup><br class="calibre3"/>30</a> The researchers, based at Stanford University and Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), found this surprising and counterintuitive. Why bother paying a monthly subscription to participate in a massively multiplayer game world if you are going to ignore the masses?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The researchers conducted interviews to explore these findings and found that players enjoyed <span class="italic">sharing</span> the virtual environment, even if there was little to no direct interaction. They were experiencing a high degree of “social presence,” a communications theory term for the sensation of sharing the same space with other people.<a id="filepos229186" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos931100" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">31</sup><br class="calibre3"/>31</a> Although the players were not fighting each other or questing together, they still considered each other virtual company. The Stanford and PARC research team dubbed this phenomenon “playing alone together.”<a id="filepos229448" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos931338" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">32</sup><br class="calibre3"/>32</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">One <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span> player explains on her blog why she prefers to play alone together: “It’s the feeling of not being alone in the world. I love being around other real players in the game. I enjoy seeing what they’re doing, what they’ve achieved, and running across them out in the world ‘doing their thing’ while I’m doing mine.”<a id="filepos229903" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos931877" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">33</sup><br class="calibre3"/>33</a> What she describes here is actually a special kind of social presence: a presence enhanced by sharing goals and engaging in the same activities. The players can <span class="italic">recognize</span> each other because they have a common understanding of what they’re doing and why. Their actions are intelligible and meaningful to each other.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Ambient sociability is a very casual form of social interaction; it may not create direct bonds, but it does satisfy our craving to feel connected to others. It creates a kind of social expansiveness in our lives—a feeling of inclusion in a social scene, and access to other people if we want it. The Stanford and PARC researchers posited that introverted players were more likely to enjoy playing alone together, and recent cognitive science studies support this theory. The best explanation scientists have for why some people are extroverted while others are introverted has to do with two differences in brain activity.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">First, introverts in general tend to be more sensitive to external sensory stimulus: the cortical region of the brain, which processes the external world of objects, spaces, and people, reacts strongly in the presence of any stimulus. Extroverts, on the other hand, have lower cortical arousal. They require <span class="italic">more</span> stimulus to feel engaged with the external world. This makes extroverts more likely to seek higher levels of social stimulation, while introverts are more likely to feel mentally exhausted after lower levels of social engagement.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Meanwhile, extroverts tend to produce more dopamine in response to social rewards—smiling faces, laughter, conversation, and touch, for example. Introverts, in turn, are less sensitive to these social reward systems but highly sensitive to <span class="italic">mental</span> activity, such as problem solving and puzzling and solo exploration. Researchers say this explains why extroverts seem happier around other people and in stimulating environments: they are feeling significantly more intense positive emotions than introverted people.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But some game researchers, including Nicole Lazzaro, believe that ambient sociability and lightweight social interaction can actually train the brain to experience social interaction as more rewarding. Lazzaro proposes that since introverts are so sensitive to the rewards of mental activity, which gaming provides, doing these activities in online social settings can create new, positive associations for introverts about social experience. In other words, games like <span class="italic">WoW</span> may make introverts feel more comfortable with social interaction in general.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Studies have yet to be conducted to offer concrete support to this theory, but initial interviews and anecdotal evidence suggest it is worth further investigation. Our solo <span class="italic">WoW</span> player describes how she can be drawn into lightweight social interaction even as she makes her own way in the online world: “Chuck a heal there, apply a buff here, kill that thing that’s about to kill that player, ask for some quick help or information, join up for a spontaneous quick group.”<a id="filepos233303" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos932255" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">34</sup><br class="calibre3"/>34</a> She remains open to these unexpected social interactions, and they are an essential part of why she likes to play alone together. She craves the <span class="italic">possibility</span> of “the spontaneous adventures that erupt between real people.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Why does this matter? Why is it a good thing for introverts to be open to more social interaction, and to find shared experiences more rewarding?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In study after study, positive-psychology researchers have shown that extroversion is highly correlated with greater happiness and life satisfaction. Extroverts are simply more likely to seek out the experiences that create social bonding and affection. As a result, they are better liked and better supported than introverts, two measures that factor heavily into quality of life. Introverts want to be liked and appreciated, and they need help just as much as anyone else; they’re just not as motivated to seek out opportunities to build up that kind of positive social feeling and exchange.<a id="filepos234442" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos932384" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">35</sup><br class="calibre3"/>35</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Fortunately, as many gamers are discovering, ambient sociability can play a key role in building up a desire for social interaction in the most introverted of people. Ambient sociability is hardly a substitute for real-world social interaction. But it can serve as a gateway to real-world socializing—and therefore greater quality of life—by helping introverts learn to view social engagement as more intrinsically rewarding than they are naturally predisposed to do.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">GAME DESIGNER</span> Daniel Cookman writes that when gamers decide to play with strangers or with people they know in real life, they’re effectively choosing between “forging new relationships or strengthening old ones.... We can ask which the stronger draw is: strong, safe relationships with existing friends, or weak, ‘risky’ relationships with new people.” Cookman says that, in most circumstances, he (and most gamers) prefers to strengthen existing relationships. The payoff is simply greater, and more clearly connected to our everyday lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Cookman is right that, on the whole, gamers make the choice to strengthen existing relationships—increasingly, online gamers report that they prefer to play online with people they know in real life. This is truer the younger a gamer you are. A recent three-year study of Internet use by young people in the United States revealed that gamers under eighteen spend 61 percent of their game time playing with real-life friends and family, rather than alone or with strangers.<a id="filepos236197" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos932757" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">36</sup><br class="calibre3"/>36</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But Cookman acknowledges that there is another factor to consider. Play with strangers or play with friends? “In order to answer this question in any meaningful fashion,” he writes, “you first need to answer a more personal question. ‘Are you lonely?’”<a id="filepos236563" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos933028" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">37</sup><br class="calibre3"/>37</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We can’t discuss the social rewards of gaming without mentioning the positive role they play in helping us combat our feelings of loneliness. As a general rule, we’d rather play with friends. But if that isn’t possible, we’ll take strangers any day over playing alone. Cookman sums up the prevailing sentiment: “I’m not sure if having a stranger yell at me in [a first-person shooter game] will result in any long-lasting friendships, but it is certainly better than being alone.”<a id="filepos237157" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos933402" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">38</sup><br class="calibre3"/>38</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The gamer website Pwn or Die, popular with an audience of teenagers and young adults, has a short manifesto on “Ways Video Games Actually Benefit ‘Real Life.’” At the top of the list is simply staving off loneliness. “When there are no kids in the neighborhood, it is late at night, or your best friend is miles away, video games give you an opportunity to interact with other people and be social.”<a id="filepos237670" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos933531" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">39</sup><br class="calibre3"/>39</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Would it be more rewarding to have a real-world space in which to have face-to-face interaction? Probably—there is significant evidence to suggest that social rewards are intensified by things like eye contact and touch. But face-to-face contact isn’t always possible. Moreover, if we’re feeling depressed or lonely, we might not have the emotional reserves to get up and get out, or to contact a real-life friend or family member. Playing a game online, like ambient sociability, can be a stepping-stone to a more positive emotional state and, with it, more positive social experiences.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">FIFTEEN YEARS AGO,</span> political scientist Robert Putnam famously worried that the United States was turning into a nation of people who go “bowling alone.” In his hugely influential book about the collapse of extended community, he documented a worrying trend: that we are increasingly likely to hunker down and prefer the company of just a few people rather than participate in civic organizations or in a larger social context in general.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Putnam considered the collapse of extended community in our everyday lives to be a major threat to our quality of life, and he made this point so persuasively that, for years since, experts have debated the best ways to reverse it. Public institutions have also tried everything possible to rebuild the traditional community infrastructure. But, as gamers are finding out, rebuilding traditional ways of connecting might not be the solution—reinvention might work better.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Gamers, without a doubt, are reinventing what we think of as our daily community infrastructure. They’re experimenting with new ways to create social capital, and they’re developing habits that provide more social bonding and connectivity than any bowling league ever could.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As a society, we may feel increasingly disconnected from family, friends, and neighbors—but, as gamers, we are adopting strategies to reverse the phenomenon. Games are increasingly a crucial social thread woven throughout our everyday lives. We’re using asynchronous social interaction in games like Lexulous and FarmVille to build stronger, stickier social connections. We’re spending more time teasing and mentoring each other in games like <span class="italic">Smooth Moves</span> and <span class="italic">Braid</span>, in order to build trust and intensify our social commitments. And we’re creating worlds of ambient sociability, as in <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span>, where even the most introverted among us have opportunities to develop their social stamina and get more social connectivity in their lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Gamers, emphatically, are <span class="italic">not</span> gaming alone.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And the more we game together, the more we get the sense that we’re creating a global community with a purpose. Gamers aren’t just trying to win games anymore. They have a bigger mission.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">They’re on a mission to be a part of something <span class="italic">epic.</span></span></div>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_21"></div>
