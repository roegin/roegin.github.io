英雄行动的史诗背景
</h1><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">It’s five hundred years in the future. The Covenant, a hostile alliance of alien species, is hell-bent on destroying humanity. You are Master Chief Petty Officer John 117—once an ordinary person, now a supersoldier, augmented with biological technologies that give you superhuman speed, strength, intelligence, vision, and reflexes. Your job is to stop the Covenant and save the world.</span></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">That’s the basic <span class="italic">Halo</span> story. It’s not that different from many other blockbuster video games. As veteran game developer Trent Polack puts it, “To look at the majority of games today, one might think that gamers care only about saving the world.” He would know: some of Polack’s previous games have asked players to save the galaxy from malevolent aliens (<span class="italic">Galactic Civilizations II</span>), save the universe from evil deities (<span class="italic">Demigod</span>), and save the world from marauding Titans (<span class="italic">Elemental: War of Magic</span>).</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Why <span class="italic">are</span> so many games about saving the world? In an industry article about the rise of “epic scale” narratives in video games, Polack suggests, “When games give players the epic scope of saving the galaxy, destroying some reawakened ancient evil, or any other classical portrayal of good versus evil on a grand scale, they’re fulfilling gamers’ power fantasies.”<a id="filepos256032" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos937250" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">13</sup><br class="calibre3"/>13</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I agree with Polack, but it’s important that we be clear on exactly what <span class="italic">kind</span> of power fantasy is being fulfilled by these save-the-world stories.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Any video game that features a slew of high-powered weapons and game-play that consists largely of shooting and blowing things up is, at one level, about the aesthetic pleasures of destruction and the positive feelings we get from exerting control over a situation.<a id="filepos256623" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos937587" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">14</sup><br class="calibre3"/>14</a> This is true of any shooter game on the market today. But we don’t need an epic story about saving the world to get those pleasures. We can get them quite effectively, and more efficiently, from a simple, plotless game like Atari’s <span class="italic">Breakout</span>. Games that come with epic, save-the-world narratives are using them to help players get a taste of a different kind of power. It’s the power to act with meaning: to do something that matters in a bigger picture. The story is the bigger picture; the player’s actions are what matters.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As Polack explains, “Story sets the stage for meaning. It frames the player’s actions. We, as designers, are not telling, we’re not showing, we’re informing the <span class="italic">doing</span>—the actions that players engage in and the feats they undergo.” These feats make up the player’s story, and the story is ultimately what has meaning.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Not every game feels like a larger cause. For a game to feel like a <span class="italic">cause</span>, two things need to happen. First, the game’s story needs to become a <span class="bold1">collective context</span> for action—shared by other players, not just an individual experience. That’s why truly epic games are always attached to large, online player communities—hundreds of thousands or millions of players acting in the same context together, and talking to each other on forums and wikis about the actions they’re taking. And second, the actions that players take inside the collective context need to feel like <span class="bold1">service:</span> every effort by one player must ultimately benefit all the other players. In other words, every individual act of gameplay has to eventually add up to something bigger.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">Halo</span> is probably the best game in the world at turning a story into a collective context and making personal achievement feel like service.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Like many other blockbuster video games, <span class="italic">Halo</span> has extensive online community features: discussion forums, wikis, and file sharing (so that players can upload and share videos of their finest gameplay moments). But Bungie and Xbox have taken it much further than these traditional context-building tools. They’ve given players groundbreaking tools for tracking the magnitude of their collective effort and unprecedented opportunities to reflect on the epic scale of their collective service.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Every <span class="italic">Halo</span> player has their own story of making a difference, and it’s documented online in their “personal service record.” It’s an exhaustive record and analysis of their individual contributions to the <span class="italic">Halo</span> community and to the Great War effort—or as Bungie calls it, “Your entire <span class="italic">Halo</span> career.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The service record is stored on the official Bungie website, and it’s fully viewable by other players. It lists all the campaign levels you’ve completed, the medals you’ve earned, and the achievements you’ve unlocked. It also includes a minute-by-minute, play-by-play breakdown of <span class="italic">every single</span> Halo <span class="italic">level or match you’ve ever played online</span>. For many <span class="italic">Halo</span> players, that means thousands of games over the past six years—ever since the <span class="italic">Halo</span> series first went online in 2004—all laid out and perfectly documented in one place.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And it’s more than just statistics. There are data visualizations of every possible kind: interactive charts, graphs, heat maps. They help you learn about your own strengths and weaknesses: where you make the most mistakes, and where you consistently score your biggest victories; which weapons you’re most proficient with, and which you’re weakest with; even which teammates help you play better, and which don’t.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Thanks to Bungie’s exhaustive data collection and sharing, everything you do in <span class="italic">Halo</span> adds up to something bigger: a multiyear history of your own personal service to the Great War.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But it’s not just your history—it’s much bigger than that. You’re contributing to the Great War effort alongside millions of other players, who also have service records online. And <span class="italic">service</span> really is a crucial concept here. A personal service record isn’t just a profile. It’s a history of a player’s contributions to a larger organization. The fact that your profile is called a “service record” is a constant reminder. When you play <span class="italic">Halo</span> online, rack up kills, and accomplish your missions, you’re <span class="italic">contributing</span>. You’re actively creating new moments in the history of the Great War.<a id="filepos261549" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos938086" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">15</sup><br class="calibre3"/>15岁</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The moments all add up. The millions of individual personal service records taken together tell the real story of <span class="italic">Halo</span>, a collective history of the Great War. They connect all the individual gamers into a community, a network of people fighting for the same cause. And the unprecedented scale of data collected and shared in these service records underscores just how epic the players’ collective story is. Bungie recently announced to players that its personal-service-record servers handled more than 1.4 <span class="italic">quadrillion</span> bytes of data requests from players in the past nine months. That’s 1.4 petabytes in computer science terms.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">To put that number in perspective, experts have estimated that the entire written works of humankind, from the beginning of recorded history, in all languages, adds up to about 50 petabytes of data.<a id="filepos262561" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos938460" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">16</sup><br class="calibre3"/>16岁</a>
<span class="italic">Halo</span> players aren’t quite there yet—but it’s not a bad start, considering that they’ve been playing together online for only six short years, compared to all of recorded human history.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">One of the best examples of innovative collective context building is the <span class="italic">Halo</span> Museum of Humanity, an online museum that purports to be from the twenty-seventh century, dedicated to “all who fought bravely in the Great War.” Of course, it’s not a real museum; it was developed by the Xbox marketing group to build a more meaningful context for <span class="italic">Halo 3</span>.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The museum features a series of videos done in the classic style of Ken Burns’ <span class="italic">Civil War</span> series: interviews with Great War veterans and historians, images from Covenant battles, all set to a hymnal score. As one blogger wrote, “The videos in the <span class="italic">Halo</span> Museum of Humanity seem like they could have been pulled straight from The History Channel.... It’s nice to see video game lore treated with this kind of reverence.”<a id="filepos263721" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos938791" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">17</sup><br class="calibre3"/>17</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Reverence—the expression of profound awe, respect and love, or veneration—is usually an emotion we reserve for very big, very serious things. But that was precisely the point of the <span class="italic">Halo</span> Museum of Humanity: to acknowledge how seriously <span class="italic">Halo</span> players take their favorite game, and to inspire the kind of epic emotions that have always been the best part of playing it.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s worked. The video series packs a real emotional wallop, despite the fact that, in the words of one player, “it’s meant to honor heroes that never existed.” <a id="filepos264435" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos939170" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">18</sup><br class="calibre3"/>18岁</a> Brian Crecente, a leading games journalist, wrote, “It left me with chills.”<a id="filepos264567" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos939494" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">19</sup><br class="calibre3"/>19</a> And online forums and blogs were full of comments expressing heart-felt emotion. One player put it best when he wrote, “Really poignant. They’ve made something real out of fiction.”<a id="filepos264804" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos939865" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">20</sup><br class="calibre3"/>20</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s not that the museum is such a believable artifact from the future. It’s that the <span class="italic">emotions</span> it provokes are believable. The online Museum of Humanity is a place to reflect on the extreme scale of the <span class="italic">Halo</span> experience: the years of service, the millions of players involved. The Great War isn’t real, but you really do feel awe when you think about the scale of the effort so many different people have made to fight it.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In the end, as one player sums it up, “<span class="italic">Halo</span> proves that you can have a shooter game with a story that really means something. It draws you in and makes you feel like you’re part of something bigger.”<a id="filepos265618" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos940027" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">21</sup><br class="calibre3"/>二十一岁</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But <span class="italic">Halo</span> isn’t just a bigger story. It’s also a bigger environment—and this brings us to our next strategy for connecting players to something bigger: built epic environments, or highly immersive spaces that are intentionally designed to bring out the best in us.</span></div>
