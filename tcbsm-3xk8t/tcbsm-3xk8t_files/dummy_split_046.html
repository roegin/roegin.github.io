</span><br class="calibre13"/>
免费大米——或者如何玩耍和喂饱饥饿的人们
</h2><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">“Feeling guilty about wasting time on computer solitaire? Join the growing guilt-free multitude at <a href="http://FreeRice.com" class="calibre11">FreeRice.com<br class="calibre3"/>免费大米网站</a>, an online game with redeeming social value.”<a id="filepos572000" href="dummy_split_079.html#filepos967123" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">11</sup><br class="calibre3"/>11</a> That’s how <span class="italic">USA Today</span> described Free Rice, a nonprofit game designed to help gamers battle world hunger while they play.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The gameplay is simple: answer a multiple-choice vocabulary question correctly, and you earn ten virtual grains of rice. The better you do, the harder the questions get; it took me only six questions in my latest game before getting stumped by this one:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic"><span class="bold1">Acrogenous</span></span>
<span class="bold1">means:</span>
<div class="calibre28"><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• created top down</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• extremely generous</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• growing from the tip of a stem</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• pointy-headed</span></blockquote></div></div><div class="calibre8"> </div></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">(<span class="italic">Hint:</span> It turns out “acrogenous” is a botanical term—see the endnotes for the answer.) <a id="filepos573271" href="dummy_split_079.html#filepos967538" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">12</sup><br class="calibre3"/>12</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">You can stack up as much virtual rice as you want, and at the end of your game, it gets converted to real rice, which is donated to the United Nations World Food Programme. (The rice is provided by sponsors whose online advertisements appear underneath every question in the game.)</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">To earn enough rice to feed one person one meal, I’d have to answer two hundred questions correctly. But it’s not the kind of game you really want to play for hours on end. In fact, usually I just play for about a minute or two, or roughly ten questions at a time, whenever I want a quick burst of satisfying productivity and feel-good activity. But earning a hundred grains a day is barely a teaspoon’s worth; luckily I’m not the only person playing. On any given day, between two hundred thousand and five hundred thousand people play Free Rice; together, according to the game’s FAQ, their efforts add up to enough rice to feed an average of seven thousand people per day.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Why is Free Rice able to capture so much engagement? It isn’t just that it is a force for good; it’s also classically good game design. It takes just seconds to complete a task, meaning you can get a lot of work done quickly. You get instant visual feedback: grains of rice stacking up in a bowl, with a constantly rising total of grains that you’ve earned. Because the game gets easier when you make mistakes and harder when you answer correctly, it’s easy to experience flow: you’re always playing at the limits of your ability. And since the game was created, in 2007, its game world has expanded significantly: there’s a seemingly endless stream of potential tasks, with thirteen different subject areas, from famous paintings and world capitals to chemical symbols and French vocabulary. There’s also a clear sense that you’re a part of something bigger as you play. As the Free Rice site explains, “Though 10 grains of rice may seem like a small amount, it is important to remember that while you are playing, so are thousands of other people at the same time. It is everyone together that makes the difference.”<a id="filepos575577" href="dummy_split_079.html#filepos967709" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">13</sup><br class="calibre3"/>13</a> So far, that difference is nothing less than epic: 69,024,128,710 grains of rice and counting—enough to provide more than 10 million meals worldwide.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Free Rice in one respect seems like a perfect embodiment of the crowdsourcing philosophy: lots of people come together to make a small contribution, all of it adding up to something bigger. But Free Rice actually falls short of real crowdsourcing. That’s because the grains of rice aren’t coming from the players—they’re coming from a small number of advertisers who agree to pay the cost of ten grains of bulk rice for every correct-answer page view. Those advertisers are paying for the gamers’ eyeballs on the page. So the actual game-play activity isn’t generating any new knowledge or value; the advertisers are just happy to have their advertisement on a page they know hundreds of thousands of people will see daily.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">That means Free Rice is less like Wikipedia and more like clever fundraising. But Free Rice is still an extremely important project, for one big reason: it irrefutably shows that gamers are, on the whole, happier when a good game also does real-world good. There’s no evidence that hundreds of thousands of people would show up to play a bad game just to help out a good cause. But the combination of good game design and real-world results is irresistible.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It also points the way to bigger possibilities. What if people playing Free Rice were actually contributing something other than their attention to advertising? What could gamers easily contribute, and what would it add up to? We can catch an even better glimpse of gamers’ potential to engage in epic problem solving in a different crowd project: Folding@home, a project designed to harness gamers’ hardware for good.</span></div>
