<span class="bold">Superstruct: Inventing the Future of Organization</span>
</span></span><br class="calibre13"/>
超结构: 创造组织的未来
</h1><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Every year, the Institute for the Future produces a Ten-Year Forecast. It’s a look ahead at the next decade, to identify new economic forces, social practices, and changing environmental realities that will impact the way leading businesses, governments, and nonprofit organizations work, and to define the new challenges they’ll face. As we like to say at IFTF, “Ten years is a good, useful horizon—distant enough to expect real changes, close enough to feel within our grasp.”<a id="filepos776816" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos989754" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">24</sup><br class="calibre3"/>24</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Each Ten-Year Forecast (TYF) has a defining theme, a driving question. In 2008, the TYF program director Kathi Vian decided that the driving question for the next year’s forecast would be: What is the future of scale for human organization?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Clearly, we were embarking on a decade of extreme-scale challenges: economic collapse, pandemics, climate change, the continuing risk of global terrorism, and disruptions to our global food supply chain, to name just a few. We knew that existing organizations would have to reinvent themselves in order to simply survive, let alone make a difference.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">“We know that the old ways of organizing the human race aren’t enough anymore. They’re not adapted to the highly connected world we’re living in. They’re not fast enough, or collaborative enough, or agile enough,” Vian wrote during our early brainstorming meetings. “We need to design better ways for the world to work together in the future. We need networked organizations that can solve problems better, move faster, be more responsive, and overcome the old ways of doing and thinking that paralyze us.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">So we wanted to find out: How might businesses, governments, and nonprofit organizations team up to make each other more resilient during crisis? How could existing organizations work together to tackle these planetary-scale problems? How should these entities engage the super-empowered individuals who want to be a part of changing the world—and who will go it alone, for better or for worse, if they don’t feel engaged?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Our hunch was that surviving the next decade would require entirely new ways of cooperating, coordinating, and creating together. So we wanted to find a new strategic language for talking about revolutionary ways of working together at extreme scales—language that could completely shift our thinking about how to adapt for the coming decade.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We looked at a lot of potential language, but as soon as we hit on the term “superstruct,” we knew we’d found it.</span></div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">superstruct</span>/ˈsüprˌstrkt/</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">verb trans. [L. <span class="italic">superstructus</span>, p.p. of <span class="italic">superstruere</span>, to build upon; <span class="italic">super-</span>, over + -<span class="italic">struere</span>, to build. See <span class="italic">super</span>-, and <span class="italic">structure</span>.]</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">To build over or upon another structure; to erect upon a foundation.<a id="filepos779714" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos990154" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">25</sup><br class="calibre3"/>25</a></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">“Superstruct” is a term that shows up most often in the fields of engineering and architecture. To superstruct a building is to extend it, to make it more resilient.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Superstructing isn’t about just making something bigger. It’s about working with an existing foundation and taking it in new directions, to reach beyond present limits. It means creating flexible connections to other structures, to mutually reinforce each other. And superstructing means growing in strategic and inventive ways so that you can create new and more powerful structures that would have been previously unimaginable.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">So <span class="italic">superstruct</span> really seemed to capture the process of extension and reinvention that we wanted to explore in our Ten-Year Forecast. But what would be the best way to investigate a process that didn’t quite exist yet?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">My graduate studies background is in a social science called “performance studies,” in which one of the core research methodologies is to actually <span class="italic">do</span>, or <span class="italic">perform</span>, the thing that you’re studying. So we decided to build a superstructure.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We decided to superstruct our own Ten-Year Forecasting project by opening it up to the public. We would conduct our primary TYF research as a live, online six-week collaborative experiment—completely open to anyone who wanted to join us.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We called this experiment, naturally, Superstruct, and we framed it as a massively multiplayer forecasting game. We wanted the world to help us forecast the future of organizing at extreme, or epic, scales in order to survive real global threats and solve real planetary-scale problems. And we committed to using whatever collective forecast our players came up with as the foundation for our annual research report and conference the following spring.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The core creative team for the project was made up of program director Kathi Vian, scenario director Jamais Cascio, and myself, the game director. We spent six months working with a team of a dozen additional IFTF researchers and designers to develop the 2019 scenario, research the game topics, create the immersive content, design the gameplay, and build the website.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The game launched on September 22, 2008, with a press release from a fictional organization called the Global Extinction Awareness System. The press release was dated September 22, 2019.</span></div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">For immediate release:</span>
<br class="calibre3"/>September 22, 2019 <br class="calibre3"/>Humans have 23 years to go</span></div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">Global Extinction Awareness System starts the countdown for Homo sapiens.</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Based on the results of a yearlong supercomputer simulation, the Global Extinction Awareness System (GEAS) has reset the “survival horizon” for <span class="italic">Homo sapiens—</span>the human race—from “indefinite” to 23 years.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">“The survival horizon identifies the point in time after which a threatened population is expected to experience a catastrophic collapse,” GEAS president Audrey Chen said. “It is the point from which a species is unlikely to recover. By identifying a survival horizon of 2042, GEAS has given human civilization a definite deadline for making substantive changes to planet and practices.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">According to Chen, the latest GEAS simulation harnessed over 70 petabytes of environmental, economic, and demographic data, and was cross-validated by ten different probabilistic models.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The GEAS models revealed a potentially terminal combination of five so-called “superthreats,” which represent a collision of environmental, economic, and social risks.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">“Each superthreat on its own poses a serious challenge to the world’s adaptive capacity,” said GEAS research director Hernandez Garcia. “Acting together, the five superthreats may irreversibly overwhelm our species’ ability to survive.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">GEAS notified the United Nations prior to making a public announcement. The spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Vaira Vike-Freiberga released the following statement: “We are grateful for GEAS’ work, and we treat their latest forecast with seriousness and profound gravity.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">GEAS urges concerned citizens, families, corporations, institutions, and governments to talk to each other and begin making plans to deal with the superthreats.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We chose an intentionally provocative starting point for the scenario for several reasons. First, we wanted players to propose awe-inspiring solutions. So we had to pose a scenario that would inspire a sense of awe and wonder—an epic “What if?” What would you do if you woke up one morning to discover that the world’s most trusted supercomputer had calculated the entire human species was as endangered as tigers, polar bears, and pandas are today?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Second, we wanted to learn something new, so we had to push our players to imagine previously unthinkable ideas. We aimed to create a forecasting context so far from their ordinary day-to-day concerns that they would feel free to practice extreme creativity and be comfortable pitching “outlier,” or unexpected, ideas.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And third, we wanted to give our players a clear goal, a way to measure their success in the game. The GEAS survival horizon gave us the perfect way to do both. We would challenge our players to work together to extend the survival horizon from the year 2042 as far as we could possibly take it. Each year they added to the horizon would represent a significant milestone in the game. (Advances in the survival horizon would be based on an algorithm factoring in the number of active players, how many game missions they completed, and how many achievements they unlocked.)</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">To ground the game in some specific forecasting topics, we identified five key areas in which players could make a significant impact on our survival horizon. These were the five superthreats, extreme-scale challenges that posed the greatest threat to humanity’s survival. But they weren’t just threats—they were also opportunities, key areas for coordinated effort and innovation, among organizations and SEHIs alike.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">If you wanted to make a difference in our game world of 2019, you had to pick one of these superthreats and start tackling it with the biggest, most surprising ideas you could come up with. These were the five superthreats:<div class="calibre28"><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• <span class="italic">Quarantine</span> covers the global response to declining health and pandemic disease, including the current respiratory distress syndrome (ReDS) crisis. The challenge: How can we protect and improve our global health, especially in the face of pandemics?</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• <span class="italic">Ravenous</span> focuses on the imminent collapse of the global food system, leading to food safety lapses and shortages worldwide. The challenge: How can we feed ourselves in more sustainable and secure ways?</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• <span class="italic">Power Struggle</span> follows the tremendous political and economic upheaval, as well as quality-of-life disruptions, we may suffer as we attempt to move from oil-based societies to solar, wind, and biofuel societies. The challenge: How can we reinvent the way we create and consume energy?</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• <span class="italic">Outlaw Planet</span> tracks the efforts to hack, grief, terrorize, or otherwise exploit the communications, sensor, and data networks we increasingly rely on to run our lives. The challenge: How can we be more secure in a globally networked society?</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">• <span class="italic">Generation Exile</span> looks at the difficulties of organizing society and government in the face of one particular challenge: the disappearance of secure habitats for three hundred million refugees and migrants, who have been forced to leave their homes and in many cases their homelands due to climate change, economic disruption, and war. The challenge: How can we govern ourselves and take better care of each other across traditional geopolitical borders?</span></blockquote></div></div><div class="calibre8"> </div></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">To help players quickly grasp the details of this complex scenario, for each of these superthreats we created a short video trailer and a series of news headlines describing unfolding events. We also released an online report, set in the year 2019, outlining some of the dilemmas each of these superthreats might provoke, and how they might interact with and magnify each other. In the report, we emphasized a sense of optimism about humanity’s ability to overcome the superthreats.</span></div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">The human species has a long history of overcoming tremendous obstacles, often coming out stronger than before. Indeed, some anthropologists argue that human intelligence emerged as the consequence of the last major ice age, a period of enormous environmental stress demanding flexibility, foresight, and creativity on the part of the small numbers of early <span class="italic">Homo sapiens</span>. Historically, those who have prophesied doom for human civilization have been proven wrong, time and again, by the capacity of our species to both adapt to and transform our conditions.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">GEAS does not argue or believe that this future is unavoidable. This is perhaps the most important element of our forecast. This is not <span class="italic">fate</span>. If we act now—and act with intelligence, flexibility, foresight, and creativity—we can avoid the final threat. We may even come out of this period far stronger than we were before.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Both the report and the trailers ended with the same call to action: Join us to invent the future of the human species. We announced that volunteers were gathering on an online social network site called Superstruct. And we issued a public invitation—on blogs, on Facebook, on e-mail, on Twitter—to join the network. Our core message: Everyone has a part to play in reinventing the way the world works. And in the end, we attracted 8,647 super-empowered hopeful individuals to contribute their best ideas for the future to our superstructing experiment.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But before they tackled the superthreats, our players had an important first mission: invent their future selves.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Like any present-day social network, our 2019 social network asked you to fill out a personal profile. But our profile was different: it focused on <span class="italic">survivability</span> . What are the specific skills, resources, and communities you can bring to bear on these superthreats? What are you uniquely qualified to contribute to reinventing the world? We encouraged players to have fun imagining their future selves, but we also told them to keep it real. This was essential. <span class="italic">Don’t</span> invent a fictional character, we told them. This is about real play, not role play. We want to know who you <span class="italic">really</span> think you might be in 2019. Feel free to dream big, but make sure it’s grounded in reality.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Here’s the profile. How would you answer these questions? Remember: It’s not who you are today. It’s who you might be in the future.</span></div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">YOUR WORLD IN 2019</span></span></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Where do you live? <br class="calibre3"/>Who do you live with? <br class="calibre3"/>What do you do? Where do you work? <br class="calibre3"/>What matters to you most?</span></div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">How did you get to be this person? Was there a particular turning point for you in the past ten years?</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"> <br class="calibre3"/></span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">YOUR UNIQUE STRENGTHS</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">What do you know more about than most people? Tell us about your skills and abilities.</span></div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Who do you know? Tell us about the communities and groups you belong to, and what kinds of people are in your social and professional networks.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">This first mission helped immerse players in the future. It required them to vividly imagine the year 2019, and how their work and lives might be different by then. It also helped them identify specific personal resources they could bring to bear on the superthreats. At heart, Superstruct was about figuring out new roles for individuals, organizations, and communities to play in much bigger, longer-term efforts to make life on this planet better. To accomplish this goal, we had to help our players make direct connections between their current skills, resources, and abilities and the demands of the future.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">If you were to ask an ordinary person if they could personally fix the economy, stop a pandemic, or prevent famine, they probably wouldn’t even know where to begin. So we gave the players a specific place to start: in their own communities, groups, and social networks, using whatever they knew best as a foundation for suggesting solutions.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Finally, this mission gave us some concrete data about our players. We asked players to tell us, confidentially, a little bit about who they were in 2008, to help us put their forecasts and ideas into context. This 2008 data didn’t appear on their public profile; it was only to help during the research process, so we could cross-reference their future ideas by real-life age, location, and occupation. We wanted to find out more about how SEHIs think of themselves and what kinds of projects they are most likely to tackle.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">So who superstructs? Here’s what we found out.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Out of just under nine thousand forecasters who joined the effort, the vast majority were between the ages of twenty and forty, with the rest spread out like a bell curve. Our youngest player was ten (he was particularly interested in the future of food, especially “lab-grown meat,” which is in fact an emerging food technology). Our oldest player was ninety (she was interested in the future of education).</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We had players from forty-nine out of fifty U.S. states and more than one hundred countries worldwide. We had a startlingly diverse group of professionals, including chief engineers, chief technical officers, chief creative officers; longshoremen, hotel concierges, and museum curators; astrophysicists, atmospheric scientists, mathematicians; nurses, plumbers, and photographers. There were also numerous college and graduate students, senior executives, members of the armed forces, and public servants.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What expertise did these diverse participants bring to the game? Players identified expertise in areas as wide as labor activism, transportation and logistics, and robotics; specialty coffee, the comic book industry, the steel industry; immigration, forestry, and fashion; tourism, health care, and journalism ; chemical engineering, caregiving, and e-commerce; consulting, defense, and human resources; forensics, human rights, and nanotechnology.<a id="filepos796949" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos990417" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">26</sup><br class="calibre3"/>26</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">These were among the skills and resources we asked players to bring to bear on the five superthreats. And we asked them to tackle the superthreats in a very specific way: by inventing superstructures.</span></div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">HOW TO INVENT A SUPERSTRUCTURE</span></span></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>

<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We’re facing superthreats, and we need to adapt.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The existing structures of human civilization just aren’t enough. We need a new set of superstructures to rise above, to take humans to the next stage.</span></div>

<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">A: A superstructure is a highly collaborative network that’s built on top of existing groups and organizations.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">THERE ARE FOUR TRAITS THAT DEFINE A SUPERSTRUCTURE:</span>
<div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">1. A superstructure brings together two or more different communities that don’t already work together.</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">2. A superstructure is designed to help solve a big, complex problem that no single existing organization can solve alone.</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">3. A superstructure harnesses the unique resources, skills, and activities of each of its subgroups. Everyone contributes something different, and together they create a solution.</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre29"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10">4. A superstructure is fundamentally new. It should sound like an idea that no one’s tried before.</span></blockquote></div></span></div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">Q: WHAT KINDS OF GROUPS CAN COME TOGETHER TO FORM SUPERSTRUCTURES?</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">A: Any kind of group at all. For profit and not-for-profit, professional and amateur, local and global, religious and secular, online and offline, fun and serious, big and small.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">ANY EXISTING COMMUNITY CAN BE ADDED TO A SUPERSTRUCTURE ! HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES:</span>

<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">Q: HOW DO I CREATE A NEW SUPERSTRUCTURE?</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">A: Start by picking a community that you already belong to. What could your community uniquely contribute to solving one or more of the superthreats? And who else do you want to work with to make it happen?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When you’re ready to share your idea, create a new wiki article. Use the wiki fields (name, motto, mission, who we need, how we work, and what we can accomplish) to describe your new superstructure.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">Q: I’VE MADE A SUPERSTRUCTURE. WHAT NEXT?</span></span></div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">A: When you have a basic description of your superstructure in place, invite other SEHIs and your own friends, colleagues, neighbors, and networks to join.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">If you’ve made your superstructure public, keep an eye on your wiki to welcome new members and to see how the superstructure evolves. If you’ve made your superstructure private, be sure to check back often to approve new members so they can help you build your superstructure.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Together, your Superstruct members can keep editing the wiki until it describes exactly the way you think your superstructure should work.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">DON’T STOP NOW!</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Once you’ve created your first superstructure, there’s lots more to do. You can create superstructures for other superthreats. Or you can design spin-off superstructures from your original superstructure. You can invent competing superstructures, or bigger superstructures to swallow up superstructures that are already existing.</span></div>

<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The most important rule for inventing a superstructure was that it should be unlike any existing organization. It should be a fundamentally new combination of people, skills, and scales of work. But it also had to be a plausible approach to a problem—a way to give people who don’t ordinarily work on challenges like hunger, pandemic, climate change, economic collapse, or network security a way to make a difference.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Inventing a superstructure was the core element of gameplay; it was how players earned survivability points (up to one hundred), which tallied into a total survivability score. The more thoughtful, clearly explained, creative, and surprising the superstructure, the more points a player earned. A player could also earn points by joining and contributing ideas to other players’ superstructures.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What, exactly, is a survivability score? We described it to players as follows:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Your Survivability Score is a number between 0 and 100 that appears in your Survival Profile. When you first join, you have a score of 0. Any score higher than 0 means you personally are becoming more and more important to the survival of the species. If you achieve a score of 100, you personally are absolutely central to the future of the human race.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In other words, our scoring system wasn’t meant to be competitive, but simply to represent your personal progress.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Let’s take a look at some brief descriptions of some of the particularly high-scoring superstructures, and the SEHIs who created them.</span></div>
