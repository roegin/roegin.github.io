<span class="bold">Ghosts of a Chance: A Game to Reinvent Membership</span>
</span></span><br class="calibre13"/>
机会的幽灵: 重塑会员资格的游戏
</h1><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Most museums offer memberships where members pay an annual fee and can then visit the museum as often as they’d like. It’s a good way to raise money and promote visitation, but it’s not a particularly good way to experience membership. Members of the museum are, for the most part, like any other visitor: they take in the museum’s offerings, but don’t interact with other members, or even know who they are.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Recently, the Smithsonian American Art Museum set out to experiment with a new model of museum membership, a way to <span class="italic">really</span> belong to a museum. It’s a model that calls for members to contribute real content to the museum’s collection and to collaborate with each other online in between museum visits. To test this more participatory model of membership, the Smithsonian developed a six-week alternate reality game called Ghosts of a Chance for one of its main facilities, the Luce Foundation Center for American Art.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The Luce Foundation Center is described as a “visible storage facility” for the Smithsonian. It displays more than thirty-five hundred pieces of American art, including sculptures, paintings, craft objects, and folk works, in densely packed floor-to-ceiling glass cases. Its primary purpose is to display as much of the vast Smithsonian collection as possible, much more than can typically be included in the other galleries.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Because it’s so packed with art, visiting the Luce Foundation Center is a bit of a treasure hunt already: among all the diverse pieces, you have to seek out the special objects that speak to you most. The center has at the core of its mission teaching visitors to really hear what the art objects have to say, and its educational materials often focus on how art is a window into the lives and times of its creators. There’s a sense in the museum that history lingers in the art objects almost like a ghost, waiting to whisper its tales to visitors. Learning how to hear those tales, and how to whisper our own histories through artwork, was the inspiration for the Ghosts of a Chance game.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The game begins with what at first seems like a real press release from the museum. Members, as well as public visitors to the museum’s website, are invited to meet two new curators at the center, Daniel Libbe and Daisy For-tunis. According to the press release, they will both be writing about their work on blogs and their social network pages. Read the fine print, however, and you realize Daniel and Daisy aren’t real curators. They’re fictional characters in a new, experimental game produced by the Smithsonian. And if you want to find out more, you have to friend these fictional characters on Facebook and start following their blogs.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">That’s when you discover that Daniel and Daisy are having a rather extraordinary experience: they’re communicating regularly with two ghosts haunting the Luce gallery, a man and a woman who lived a century and a half ago. Angered at being forgotten by history, the ghosts are threatening to destroy the museum’s precious artifacts—and they won’t rest until <span class="italic">their</span> stories are represented in the museum’s glass cases.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Frightened but resourceful, Daniel and Daisy make special arrangements for a one-day exhibit called, naturally, Ghosts of a Chance. But ethereal ghosts can’t make real art—so Daniel and Daisy need the museum members to help. It’s up to them, the players, to interpret the two ghosts’ histories—by transforming their tales into art objects that the curators promise to display in a special gallery event.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And so a gameplay mechanism is established. Each week, the ghosts reveal a new dramatic chapter in their lives to Daniel and Daisy, describing in mysterious terms the kind of art piece that they feel would best capture their secret histories. Daniel and Daisy then pass on the new information to members of the game and charge them with the important mission of making that art real, then sending it to the Smithsonian for inclusion in the exhibit.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In the first mission, for example, players learn that one of the ghosts is tortured by memories of a dear friend, a young lady from a very wealthy family:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">She’s a girl from another time, she blushes and rustles as she passes, taffeta skirt buoyed by crinolines. She has taught herself to fling her burnished curls with just a turn of her head; she and her sister practiced for hours in front of an oval mirror. At twenty, she is poised; she understands her value; her next great adventure awaits her. A mate. Travel. Then, domesticity—which involves a love of gardening, cleanliness and the proper care of servants.... <a id="filepos436495" href="dummy_split_076.html#filepos953973" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">4</sup><br class="calibre3"/>4</a></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Players are then challenged to craft this girl’s most prized piece of jewelry, what the ghosts call the Necklace of the Subaltern Betrayer. Instructions for designing the necklace are spare, and poetic: “The Necklace I want should fit perfectly around her neck, but remain there only long enough for me to steal it right off again.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Players discussed the challenge in online forums: What does “subaltern” mean? (They learned that it is a political-science term for people who lack power or social status in a given society.) They debated: Should the necklace be old-fashioned, or a modern interpretation of the tale? They collaborated to unpack the meaning of the tale, to analyze the cultural clues embedded in it, and to strategize about how to craft a necklace that could evoke such a story and communicate such intense feelings.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As a community, the players decided the necklace should convey what it would feel like to wear the heavy and inflexible societal expectations of a woman of money and privilege. One player created a necklace titled “Someone to Watch Over Me,” comprising more than a dozen squares of fabric, each screenprinted with the image of a different staring eye. The eyes are stacked on top of each other in geometric sets of one, two, and three, and strung along a pretty pink ribbon. The aesthetic is both girly and intimidating. Another player submitted a necklace titled “Enclosure,” which appears to be constructed from barbed wire strung with rubies. Both the title and design of the work suggest that its wearer is trapped and limited by her social status, her riches preventing her from living the life she might otherwise pursue.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">All of the player-created artifacts received by the museum were cataloged online and archived at the Luce Foundation Center. Players around the world could see the different interpretations of the challenge—either online or in person by visiting the objects on temporary display at the museum. In the end, more than six thousand Smithsonian members and fans participated in the online experience, while two hundred fifty attended the opening of the Ghosts of a Chance exhibit in person.<a id="filepos438994" href="dummy_split_076.html#filepos954318" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">5</sup><br class="calibre3"/>5</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Why design a game, instead of issuing an open invitation to design for the museum? There are two good reasons. Because it was a “game” and not a serious art competition, people who wouldn’t normally feel capable of contributing artwork were free to try without risking embarrassment. The game structure, with its clues and narratives, also gave a larger and more atypical museum membership—in this case, mostly students and teenagers—an opportunity to participate in the making of the exhibit, through online discussion and analysis of the artworks, even if the members didn’t contribute art themselves. These players helped serve as virtual “curators” for the Ghosts of a Chance exhibit.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">To become a member of any community, you need to understand the goals of the community and the accepted strategies and practices for advancing those goals. Participating in Ghosts of a Chance educates museumgoers about both. Although it was a game, the participating players were treated seriously as both artists and curators. As Nina Simon, a leading expert on the use of technology in museums, reported at the time, “The game artifacts [were] officially entered into the collection database and stored (and accessed) the way other artifacts are—via appointment, white gloves, that sort of thing. In this way, the secret rules of museums become new hoops for the gamers to jump through—hoops that will likely add a level of delight as they expose the inner workings of the museum.”<a id="filepos440637" href="dummy_split_076.html#filepos954702" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">6</sup><br class="calibre3"/>6</a> In other words, the gameplay knocks down the “fourth wall” that usually separates the work of the museum’s curators and the visitors. And in doing so, it completely reinvents the idea of museum membership, making it possible for a real museum <span class="italic">community</span> to emerge.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We have become accustomed to viewing museums as spaces of consumption—of knowledge, of art, of ideas. Ghosts of a Chance shows how we can turn them into spaces of meaningful social participation, driven by the three fundamental components of gaming communities: collaboration, creation, and contribution toward a larger goal.</span></div>
