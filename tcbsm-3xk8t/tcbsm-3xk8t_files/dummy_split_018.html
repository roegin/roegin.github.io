<div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre15"><span class="bold">CHAPTER FIVE</span></span></div><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">Stronger Social Connectivity</span></span></div><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">M</span>ore than 5 million people are playing the online word game Lexulous on Facebook. And most of them are playing it with their moms.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When the game was released in 2007, it became the first Facebook application to achieve a mass audience, and the familiarity of the gameplay was one of its main attractions. If you know how to play Scrabble, then you already know how to play Lexulous<span class="italic">—</span>it’s just a slightly modified and unauthorized version of the classic board game, combined with online chat.<a id="filepos197991" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos921572" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">1</sup><br class="calibre3"/>1</a> There’s no time limit on turns, and games stay active even when you log out of the social network. Whenever it’s your turn, Facebook sends you an alert to your home page, your e-mail, or your mobile phone.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Here’s how one Lexulous reviewer sums up its cross-generational appeal: “Everyone in your social network, even your mom, knows how to play Scrabble.” <a id="filepos198459" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos922122" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">2</sup><br class="calibre3"/>2</a> No doubt that’s why so many of the online rave reviews include the phrase “my mom”—like this one: “I live in Atlanta, and my mom’s in Texas. We love to have game night across the miles. Although I am sure she needs a break from me kicking her butt all of the time. (Love you, Mom!)”<a id="filepos198795" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos922488" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">3</sup><br class="calibre3"/>3</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I’ve been reading game reviews for most of my life and I’ve never seen anything close to this many mom references. In fact, it’s not that much of a stretch to say that, for many, the primary reason they play <span class="italic">Lexulous</span> is to have an excuse to talk to their mom every day.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s not just online reviews that have given me this suspicion—there’s photographic evidence as well. Lexulous games are private, but players often post screenshots of their most triumphant moments on photo-sharing sites like Flickr and Photobucket. In these screenshots, which usually have titles like “Online Scrabble with Mom” or “In Which I Beat My Mother at Lexulous,” you get a glimpse of the kind of everyday familial checking-in that runs alongside the wordplay.<a id="filepos199712" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos922889" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">4</sup><br class="calibre3"/>4</a> Much of the chat is mundane game talk, but you also see a constant stream of catching up, like these messages spied on Flickr: “Have you started your internship yet? How is that going?”<a id="filepos199951" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos923565" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">5</sup><br class="calibre3"/>5</a> and “Knee still hurt. Putting a lot of ice on it.”<a id="filepos200055" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos923856" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">6</sup><br class="calibre3"/>6</a> Or “What are you doing after work?” and “Your stepfather says hello.”<a id="filepos200178" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos924171" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">7</sup><br class="calibre3"/>7</a> Some chat messages simply express users’ happiness to be playing together, like this one from a mom to two daughters: “Glad to see you two, even if you do spank me when we play. :)”<a id="filepos200413" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos924572" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">8</sup><br class="calibre3"/>8</a> Of course, there are tons of messages that simply say: “I love you.”<a id="filepos200536" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos924876" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">9</sup><br class="calibre3"/>9</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Judging from the shared screenshots, it’s not <span class="italic">just</span> moms whom players use Lexulous to keep in touch with daily. There are also plenty of running games against dads, cousins, siblings, in-laws, former coworkers, faraway friends, and spouses on business trips. (That’s when I most frequently play Lexulous—I keep a game running against my husband when I’m traveling for work. It helps me feel like we’re actually doing something together, not just checking in.)</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Because you don’t have to be online playing at the same time, it’s easy to organize a game with anyone else, no matter where or how busy they are. You can easily keep up with the game by playing literally only a few minutes a day. And by keeping running games going with your real-life friends and family, you’re ensuring daily opportunities to actively connect with the people you care about most.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The tight-knit nature of the Lexulous game world wasn’t a necessary outcome of the game’s design. On Facebook, you can technically start a Lexulous game with anyone—even people you don’t know—but most people play against people they already count as Facebook “friends.” Playing Lexulous is checking in with our loved ones, but with a purpose. For anyone who has ever needed a gentle reminder to stay in touch, Lexulous provides a motivation. It helps us stay actively connected, by reminding us that it’s literally “our turn” to say something. And when there’s a game on the line, suddenly staying in touch is not just pleasant and gratifying—it is also addictive.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The secret to the addictiveness of Lexulous is its <span class="italic">asynchronous</span> gameplay: players don’t have to be online at the same time, and can take their turns whenever they want. Some Lexulous games go quickly, with players trading words every few minutes, but many games go quite slowly, with players taking just one or two turns a day, or even less often than that.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The unpredictable rhythm of asynchronous play adds a measure of anticipation. You’re thinking about your next play, but you don’t know when you’ll be able to make it. You’re motivated to act, but you have to wait for your Facebook friends to check back into the game. And because you often have no idea if your friends are still logged on or paying attention to the game, there’s an emotional buildup to waiting for their next moves. As one player puts it, “You have to be addicted AND patient.”<a id="filepos203271" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos925200" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">10</sup><br class="calibre3"/>10</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The addictiveness of the game pushes us to initiate social interaction with members of our extended social network whom we might ordinarily leave out of our daily life online. Indeed, starting a new game with someone is making a commitment to interact with them at least a dozen or so times in the near future. And when you’ve got five or ten or twenty games going at once, you’ve effectively scheduled hundreds of microinteractions with people you like into your everyday routine.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">According to user metrics reported in an article in the <span class="italic">Wall Street Journal</span>, on average one-third of registered Lexulous players at any given time have logged in at least thirty straight days in a row.<a id="filepos204133" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos925493" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">11</sup><br class="calibre3"/>11</a> This is a measure of the remarkable <span class="italic">stickiness</span> of social network gaming—it capitalizes brilliantly on the increased motivation we feel when we play a good game. It leverages our increased interest and optimism to help us satisfy our often otherwise thwarted desire to feel more connected with friends and family.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Simply put, social network games make it both <span class="italic">easier</span> and <span class="italic">more fun</span> to maintain strong, active connections with people we care about but who we don’t see or speak to enough in our daily lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Eric Weiner, an independent foreign correspondent and author of <span class="italic">The Geography of Bliss,</span> has covered happiness trends throughout the world. His research has confirmed for him that “our happiness is completely and utterly intertwined with other people: family and friends and neighbors.... Happiness is not a noun or verb. It’s a conjunction. Connective tissue.”<a id="filepos205197" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos925883" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">12</sup><br class="calibre3"/>12</a> Games like Lexulous are intentionally designed to strengthen the connective tissue within our social networks. Each move we make in the game is a conjunction.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We clearly need more social conjunctions in our lives. As numerous economists and positive psychologists have observed, globally we make the mistake of becoming less social the richer we become as individuals, and as a society. As Weiner observes: “The greatest source of happiness is other people—and what does money do? It isolates us from other people. It enables us to build walls, literal and figurative, around ourselves. We move from a teeming college dorm to an apartment to a house and, if we’re really wealthy, to an estate. We think we’re moving up, but really we’re walling off ourselves.”<a id="filepos206071" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos926081" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">13</sup><br class="calibre3"/>13</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Games like Lexulous can help us start chipping away at those walls. Lexulous was the first breakthrough social network game, but since its success, the genre has experienced dramatic growth—particularly on Facebook. In early 2010, a virtual farming game called FarmVille hit an astonishing benchmark: 90 million active players on Facebook, nearly 30 million of whom log in on any given day to harvest their virtual crops and tend to their virtual livestock.<a id="filepos206642" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos926216" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">14</sup><br class="calibre3"/>14</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s an unprecedented scale of participation in a single online game. Roughly one in seventy-five people on the planet is currently playing FarmVille, and one in two hundred people on the planet logs in on any given day to manage and grow their virtual farm. What accounts for this global popularity? FarmVille is the first game to combine the blissful productivity of <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span> with the easy gameplay and social connectivity of Lexulous.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Half the fun of FarmVille is earning experience points and gold in order to level up and earn access to better crops and farm equipment, more exotic animals, and a bigger land plot. Every time you log in to the game, you can improve your stats by undertaking a series of simple, point-and-click tasks: plow the soil, buy and plant the seeds, harvest the crops, pet your farm animals. Each crop takes between twelve hours and four days in real time to yield a harvest, so checking in every day or so becomes a regular habit. You start the game able to harvest just strawberries and soybeans on a humble two-by-six-square plot. Over time, you can work your way up to a “mighty plantation” plot of twenty-two by twenty-two squares, on which you can grow lilies, yellow melons, and coffee—not to mention care for bunny rabbits, pinto horses, and golden chickens.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But the real genius of FarmVille is the social layer on top of this immensely satisfying self-improvement work. The first time you log in to the game, you see a list of your real-life Facebook friends who are already tending their own virtual farms. You can make any or all of them your “neighbors” in the game and visit their farms whenever you want to see how they’re doing.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">You don’t interact directly with these neighbors—instead, like most Lexulous play, FarmVille is an entirely asynchronous experience. While you’re tending your own farm, pop-up windows nudge you to pay attention to your friends’ and families’ farms: “Chelsea could use help on her farm. Can you give her a hand?” or “Ralph’s crops are looking a little puny. Could you please fertilize them?” Most players spend up to half their time in FarmVille helping others: raking up their leaves, shooing away raccoons, or feeding their chickens. You can also send your neighbors one free gift every day—a virtual avocado tree, a bale of hot pink hay, or a duck, for instance. Meanwhile, whenever you log back in to the game, you’ll see a list of neighbors who have helped your farm, and you’re likely to find a pile of presents to accept.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The gifts aren’t real, of course. The favors don’t help you in your everyday life. But the gesture isn’t an empty one. Every gift or favor someone bestows upon you helps you achieve your goals in the game. And it’s a virtuous circle. Every time you see that someone has helped your farm, you feel the urge to reciprocate. Over time, you build up a rhythm of checking in and helping others in your social network every single day.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s not a good substitute for real interaction, but it helps keep extended friends and family in our daily lives when we might otherwise be too busy to stay connected. Games like Lexulous and FarmVille ensure we’ll show up and do our part to nurture our relationships daily, and make a gesture of friendship whenever it’s our turn.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And so we have our fifth fix for reality:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre14"><span class="calibre7"><span class="bold">FIX #5: STRONGER SOCIAL CONNECTIVITY</span></span></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">Compared with games, reality is disconnected. Games build stronger social bonds and lead to more active social networks. The more time we spend interacting within our social networks, the more likely we are to generate a subset of positive emotions known as “prosocial emotions.”</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Prosocial emotions—including love, compassion, admiration, and devotion—are feel-good emotions that are directed toward others. They’re crucial to our long-term happiness because they help create lasting social bonds.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Most of the prosocial emotions that we get from gaming today aren’t necessarily built in to the game design; they’re more of a side effect of spending more time playing together. Case in point: my husband and I first fell in love when we spent six weeks in each other’s apartments playing a mystery adventure game called <span class="italic">Grim Fandango</span> on my laptop. Falling in love wasn’t so much anything about that game in particular as it was a result of spending so much time working together to solve puzzles—not to mention negotiating who got to control the mouse and keyboard, and when—in order to lead us through the virtual world. Similarly, any pair or group of people who consistently play a game together, online or face-to-face, will have increased opportunities to express admiration for each other, to devote themselves to a common goal, to express sympathy for others’ losses, and even to fall in love. (Which reminds me of the most interesting comment I’ve eavesdropped on by browsing Lexulous screenshots: “Quite a close game again. Loser has to marry the winner?”<a id="filepos212409" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos926847" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">15</sup><br class="calibre3"/>15岁</a>)</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But beyond this kind of all-purpose social benefit to playing games together, there are two specific prosocial emotions that games give us: <span class="bold1">happy embarrassment</span> and <span class="bold1">vicarious pride</span>. Let’s take a look at why these two prosocial emotions matter, and how online games generate them better than real-world interaction.</span></div>
