替代的骄傲
</h1><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">In a recent major study of more than one thousand gamers, a little-known prosocial emotion called “naches” ranked number eight on the top ten list of emotions that gamers say they want to feel while playing their favorite games. <span class="italic">Naches</span>, a Yiddish word for the bursting pride we feel when someone we’ve taught or mentored succeeds, ranked just below surprise and fiero.<a id="filepos221775" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos928381" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">21</sup><br class="calibre3"/>二十一岁</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The term “naches” hasn’t caught on in the gamer world the way “pwn” or “fiero” has. But players in the study frequently described a kind of vicarious pride from playing over someone else’s shoulder, and giving advice and encouragement—especially on games they themselves had already mastered. The author of the study, Christopher Bateman, an expert in both cognitive psychology and game design, adopted the term “naches” to describe this phenomenon, reporting, “Players seem to really enjoy training their friends and family to play games, with a whopping 53.4 percent saying it enhances their enjoyment.”<a id="filepos222494" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos928543" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">22</sup><br class="calibre3"/>22</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s no surprise that mentoring our friends and family in gameplay makes us happy and brings us closer together. Paul Ekman, a pioneering emotions researcher and an expert on the phenomenon of naches, explains that this particular emotion is also likely an evolved mechanism, designed to enhance group survival. The happiness we get from cheering on friends and family ensures our personal investment in other people’s growth and achievements. It encourages us to contribute to someone else’s success, and as a result we form networks of support from which everyone involved benefits.<a id="filepos223192" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos928672" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">23</sup><br class="calibre3"/>23</a> And because naches is so strongly correlated with survival, Ekman says, we feel it intensely. We don’t describe ourselves as “bursting with pride” over our own success, but we do for others; this language suggests that the feeling of naches is even more explosive than personal fiero.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">However, we don’t naturally explode with pride at someone else’s success if we haven’t helped and encouraged them; too often, we feel jealousy or resentment. If we aren’t actively contributing to the achievement with our support, then our emotional systems don’t register vicarious pride. To generate the emotional reward of naches, we have to throw ourselves into the act of mentoring.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Most parents live in an almost constant state of naches. Unfortunately, outside of parenthood, we aren’t always alert to opportunities for naches—among friends, between husband and wife, or from children toward their parents—because we don’t have significant incentive or encouragement to mentor each other in everyday school or work. For the most part, we live in a culture of individual achievement, or what Martin Seligman calls “the waxing of the self” and “the waning of the commons.”<a id="filepos224525" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos928945" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">24</sup><br class="calibre3"/>24</a> He explains, “The society we live in takes the pleasures and pains, the successes and failures of the individual with unprecedented seriousness.”<a id="filepos224726" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos929108" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">25</sup><br class="calibre3"/>25</a> And when we see success or failure as an entirely individual affair, we don’t bother to invest time or resources in someone else’s achievements.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We need more naches, which helps explain the rise in single-player games being played with two or more people in the same room. Game researchers who study industry trends report that, increasingly, one person will play a game while another, or others, watch, encourage, and advise.<a id="filepos225266" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos929248" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">26</sup><br class="calibre3"/>26</a> What makes this scenario attractive—and here is a big difference between ordinary life and games—is that computer and video games are perfectly replicable obstacles, we know in advance that our support will be useful, and we know exactly what our friends and family members are getting themselves in for.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The notoriously difficult puzzle game <span class="italic">Braid,</span> by independent game developer Jonathan Blow, is a perfect example of this phenomenon. Players must work their way through thirty-seven monster-filled puzzle rooms in order to rescue a princess. Early reviews of the single-player game were raves, but many reviewers worried that the reliance on puzzles would limit the replay value of the game. Once you’d solved a puzzle, one reviewer wrote, “there is little incentive to come back for seconds.”<a id="filepos226182" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos929619" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">27</sup><br class="calibre3"/>27</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But a large amount of anecdotal evidence from gamer blogs and forums suggests that gamers are revisiting <span class="italic">Braid</span>—in order to generate naches. Players seem absolutely tickled to watch friends and family work out the a-ha moments for each puzzle, lending their advice and positive morale in the face of the game’s frustrating mental challenges. “Just finished the game, now I’m watching my wife work through it and it’s a delight,” one husband-turned-mentor writes.<a id="filepos226764" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos929903" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">28</sup><br class="calibre3"/>28</a> Another says, “I finished the game last night and only needed help from my kids on two of the very final puzzle pieces. I think they were very proud of their mom!”<a id="filepos226983" href="dummy_split_072.html#filepos930181" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">29</sup><br class="calibre3"/>29</a> Games give us the opportunity to learn and master new challenges, and usually we learn skills that we can pass on to the other gamers in our lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Not all the social rewards we get from playing games are about strengthening bonds with people we already know. Social contact with strangers can offer different kinds of emotional reward, at the right times. One of these rewards that is unique to massively multiplayer online game environments is something researchers call “ambient sociability.” It’s the experience of playing alone together, and it’s a kind of social interaction that even the most introverted among us can enjoy.</span></div>
