<span class="bold">The Hope of Rock Star Success</span>
</span></span><br class="calibre13"/>
摇滚明星成功的希望
</h1><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">To be a rock star is shorthand in our culture for supersized success. It’s one of our favorite symbols of status and fame—and it’s something that virtually none of us has any <span class="italic">real</span> hope of achieving. But when you play <span class="italic">Rock Band 2</span>, you get to aspire to rock stardom, with a knowing wink.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">Rock Band</span> is a game for up to four friends who perform the role of rock stars by singing into a microphone, banging on a plastic drum kit, and pressing out chords on plastic guitars with buttons instead of strings. You follow musical cues from the game, which tell you which combination of notes to hit—or sing—and when. All the while, your customizable rock star avatar appears on the screen, rocking out on a stage.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Of course, you won’t become a real rock legend by playing a video game. But you do get to perform alongside friends and family, playing the hits and adopting the role of ultimate rock stars: the Who, the Grateful Dead, Pearl Jam, Nirvana, Guns N’ Roses, the Rolling Stones, Bob Dylan, and the Beatles, to name a few. And you’re performing the role in a way that feels genuine because it’s such an active, hands-on experience.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When you are on vocals, you’re singing the actual lyrics, and you have to sing well—the microphone has a pitch register to detect if you’re singing the right notes at the right times. The drums are also a fairly realistic stand-in, with four different pressure-sensitive drum pads arranged at realistic heights, a drum pedal, and two cymbal add-ons. When you’re hitting away with your drumsticks, trying to match the timing and arrangement of the falling notes on the screen, you really are making a rhythmic noise. Even professional drummers have remarked that it serves as a reasonable approximation of real rock drumming.<a id="filepos186305" href="dummy_split_071.html#filepos919429" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">14</sup><br class="calibre3"/>14</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As for the guitar and the bass—well, that’s a more abstract kind of music making. Jesper Juul, a well-known academic researcher of video games, calls it the difference between “playing music,” or actually making the musical sounds, and “performing music,” or doing complex actions that get translated into musical sounds.<a id="filepos186739" href="dummy_split_071.html#filepos919845" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">15</sup><br class="calibre3"/>15岁</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Holding down different combinations of button frets <span class="italic">sort of</span> feels like using different frets to play different chords, and toggling the strum bar back and forth <span class="italic">sort of</span> feels like strumming the strings. More realistically, you’re playing according to the same rhythms as a real guitarist would, and your fingers <span class="italic">are</span> moving deftly around the way they might on a real fret board. It’s not playing real music, but it’s performing musical and rhythmic actions in a way that feels closely connected to the actual song.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">On all the instruments, the more accurately you hit your notes, the better and fuller the backing song tracks sound. If you’re messing up on drums, the drum track disappears from the song. If you’re hitting only half your guitar notes, the guitar track sounds spotty. But if the entire band is playing successfully, the song is virtually identical to the original artist’s track.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Alex Rigopulos, one of the creators of the <span class="italic">Rock Band</span> series, has said that one of the goals of the game is for “the music to come alive when you’re playing.”<a id="filepos188047" href="dummy_split_071.html#filepos920310" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">16</sup><br class="calibre3"/>16岁</a> And that’s the best way to describe the sensation of playing the game. Although you’re not really “playing” the music, you <span class="italic">are</span> making the music come to life. You can really hear the impact of your efforts in the song that’s produced—and hopefully you’re making it sound better. The more complicated your finger work or rhythm work, or the more demanding the pitch detector is of you, the more real the connection between your work and how the song feels.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Every step up the difficulty chart gives you a more complicated set of musical actions to perform. And each added layer of complexity feels more closely connected to the real musical work of the song: more complex chords or deftly syncopated drumbeats or pitch perfection.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">For all of these reasons, getting better at <span class="italic">Rock Band</span> feels like a truly worthy goal. You are mastering your favorite songs in a way that will let you connect and interact with them, <span class="italic">and</span> potentially perform them in front of an audience. This is perhaps the game’s biggest secret to cultivating the hope of success: the <span class="italic">Rock Band</span> gaming culture extends many, many opportunities to perform in front of audiences. You can perform in front of friends and family in your own home. You can go to bars in just about every major city to participate in <span class="italic">Rock Band</span> game nights and perform on a real stage. And <span class="italic">Rock Band</span> is also one of the most popular choices for live video game tournaments these days.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The possibility of not only mastering a song, but also showing off that mastery to others, amplifies the optimistic drive. And fortunately for players who want to really master the hard and extreme versions of their favorite songs, failure in <span class="italic">Rock Band</span> is about as entertaining and energizing as failure can get.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The fun of <span class="italic">Rock Band</span> failure starts with the audio effects. If you get behind the beat or off your pitch or hit too many wrong notes, the song audibly starts to fall apart. First you hear bad notes in the musical accompaniment. Then you hear heckles and boos from the crowd. The more you fail, the more the song falls apart. Eventually, if you’re bad enough, the visual effects kick in: you’ll be booed off the stage by the animated crowd while your avatar pouts and skulks around the stage and all the band members shake their fists and scowl at each other. It’s a highly entertaining fail sequence—so over-the-top that you can’t help but laugh at yourself.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Even better, the “fail sequence” in real life is often more entertaining than the online version. When your performance power bar hits the red zone, indicating that you are about to be booed offstage, you can’t help yourself: you give it one last shot, whaling away at your instrument the best you can. You fling the drumsticks around like crazy, or strain your vocal chords to the farthest extremes of your range, or mash the plastic guitar frets and thrash your strum button like a maniac. That last desperate rush of play is energizing even if you’re playing alone—but when you’re playing with at least one other person, it’s also hysterically funny.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Combined with the positive emotions that this kind of spectacular failure sparks, you also get a bit of crucial information every time you wipe out on a song: an exact percentage readout of how far in the song you got before being booed off the stage. This information shows you what you’ve positively accomplished—even if it’s only 33 percent, you’ve survived a third of the way through the song. You haven’t so much failed as achieved partial success. And the higher your percentage gets, the more capable and confident you feel—and the desire for one more go at the song kicks in.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">This desire isn’t misdirected: the game environment supports your hope of success in several key ways. For instance, each player in your band can select a different difficulty level, meaning your experienced drummer can play on hard while your vocalist scrapes by on medium and your beginner guitarist takes it easy. This allows each player to set his or her own customized and realistic goal, while still playing the same song with the group.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">If you’re playing with friends, you can also “save” each other from musical disaster. If the bassist wipes out, the guitarist can play a spectacular solo and revive her. If the drummer fails, the singer can belt the chorus perfectly to bring him back into the game. You can actually fail and be revived by other band members twice before you get booed off for good. And, crucially, saves are dependent on the successful effort of another band member. One member’s failure pushes the others to do better.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The real-time feedback from the game also makes it easy to learn from your mistakes. When you’re playing the drum or string instruments, you get visual confirmation of every note you hit or miss. You know instantly that you’re off the beat or getting your chords wrong, and it’s easy to identify exactly where you’re getting tripped up. When you’re the singer, you can watch the musical staff to see if you’re perfectly on pitch, sharp, or flat. You can adjust in real time, sliding up or down to hit the right note—and after a few goes at the same song, you actually start to sound better.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">All of these features make <span class="italic">Rock Band</span> feel like a learning environment. And playing really does seem to help us grow musically, even if it’s just a better understanding of the rhythms and tracks of songs we’ve always loved, or a greater confidence performing in front of friends and family.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Moreover, research suggests that players of music video games are increasingly driven to play <span class="italic">real</span> musical instruments. In a 2008 study of more than seven thousand <span class="italic">Rock Band</span> and <span class="italic">Guitar Hero</span> players<span class="italic">,</span> 67 percent of the non-musicians in the group reported that they had been inspired to pick up a real instrument since they’d started playing the video games. Meanwhile, 72 percent of the gamers who considered themselves musicians reported that they’d spent more time playing their real instruments since beginning to play music video games.<a id="filepos194829" href="dummy_split_071.html#filepos920712" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">17</sup><br class="calibre3"/>17</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">No major research has been published yet on whether games like <span class="italic">Rock Band</span> confer real musical ability. But these games are without a doubt conferring real optimism, which in turn inspires real musical participation.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">YOU CAN PLAY</span>
<span class="italic">Rock Band</span> alone—practicing any of the four instruments by yourself—but gamer surveys indicate that hardly anyone does. In fact, a 2008 study by the Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project looked at the role of video games in family life and explicitly credited music video games like <span class="italic">Rock Band</span> for increasing the amount of time gamers of all ages spend playing together.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It’s no coincidence that one of the most optimism-building video games is also one of the most social. One of the biggest hopes we have for our own success is to share it. We want others to see our strengths, and to reflect our achievements back to us. Success, as they say, means nothing alone. For all the positive feedback that a game can give us, we crave the praise and admiration of our friends and family even more.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In fact, studies have shown that optimism makes us more likely to seek out social support and develop strong relationships.<a id="filepos196324" href="dummy_split_071.html#filepos921282" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">18</sup><br class="calibre3"/>18岁</a> When we feel a strong sense of agency and motivation, we draw other people closer into our lives. And that’s why so much of the fun failure we experience in games is increasingly taking place in a social context. More and more, we are inviting our friends and family to play with us, whether it’s in person or online. We seek out opportunities to perform our favorite games in front of audiences. And we form long-term teams, like our <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span> guilds and our rock bands.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">It may have once been true that computer games encouraged us to interact more with machines than with each other. But if you still think of gamers as loners, then you’re not playing games.</span></div>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_17"></div>
