<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">While reaching the 10 billion kill milestone was a significant community achievement, <span class="italic">Halo</span> players have actually spent more time working on two other epic projects—both collaborative knowledge projects. The first epic project involves documenting the <span class="italic">Halo</span> world on wikis and discussion forums. The other is a project to build up each other’s collective ability to fight the Covenant and play a better game with each other. Both projects take place largely on discussion forums and wikis.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">To give you an indication of the scale of the collective effort to document the <span class="italic">Halo</span> world and improve player ability within it, players have written more than 21 million discussion forum posts on the official Bungie <span class="italic">Halo</span> forums alone. Meanwhile, the largest <span class="italic">Halo</span> wiki has just under six thousand different articles, created and edited by 1.5 million registered users.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">Halo</span> players are also sharing knowledge to make each other better gamers. While the Halopedia wiki helps players construct the epic saga of the <span class="italic">Halo</span> series, the Halowiki (which describes itself as a “sister site” to Halopedia) focuses exclusively on multiplayer strategy and techniques. Its “values” statement sets the tone for epic knowledge sharing:<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">This site serves one purpose: <a href="http://Halowiki.net" class="calibre11">Halowiki.net<br class="calibre3"/>Halowiki. net</a> shall help players at all skill levels improve and/or find even more enjoyment in their <span class="italic">Halo 3</span> online experience. Share what you know. Let others share what they know with you. We must get even the most skilled players to share their knowledge. The end result shall be that we all raise our skills and fun together. Let’s try to visit the limits of our abilities!<a id="filepos280043" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos942985" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">30</sup><br class="calibre3"/>30</a></span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The scope of Halowiki is as staggering as its sister site. Under the tips section alone, there is an A to Z catalog of more than 150 different categories of tips, from “Bad habits to avoid in team games” and “Communication tips,” to “How to use vehicles effectively” and “Last-resort tips when all else fails.” Each individual category of tips contains hundreds of specific pieces of advice, contributed by different gamers.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The strategy section, on the other hand, contains more complex advice, sorted into roughly one hundred different categories, from “Close-range weapon mastery” and “Using ancient practices—advice from Sun Tzu’s <span class="italic">The Art of War</span>,” to one of my personal favorites: “Retraining your brain to not be afraid to die in the game.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In total, there are more than one thousand different sections on Halowiki that compile players’ firsthand knowledge playing the game into a collective intelligence resource. Ultimately, for members of the <span class="italic">Halo</span> community, this resource serves a greater purpose than just creating better <span class="italic">Halo</span> players. Adding a bit of knowledge to the wiki validates that you know at least one thing that matters to millions of other people. It might be just a bit of <span class="italic">Halo</span> trivia—but there’s nothing trivial about the positive feeling you get when you make a contribution that millions of other people can value and appreciate.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic"><span class="bold1">HALO</span></span>
<span class="bold1">HAS CONSISTENTLY</span> pushed the limits of epic game design for a decade now—the first game in the series was released in 2001. But plenty of other online games are doing their part to invent new ways for gamers to become a part of something bigger. One of the most interesting recent experiments in epic game design is a project called Season Showdown, developed by EA Sports for its best-selling college football series <span class="italic">NCAA Football</span>. Season Showdown is the first significant effort in the sports video game genre—a highly successful genre, representing more than 15 percent of all game sales—to create the same kinds of epic emotional rewards more traditionally associated with save-the-world games like <span class="italic">Halo</span>.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">“Every Game Counts” is the tagline for <span class="italic">NCAA Football 10.</span> Of course, this begs the question: counts toward what? The short answer is: every game played counts toward a national championship. It’s not the real national championship, but not an entirely virtual one, either.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When you sign up to play <span class="italic">NCAA Football 10</span> online, the first thing you do is declare a team allegiance. You can pick any one of the 120 real-world college teams represented in the game, from Ohio State, Notre Dame, or Stanford to Florida State, Army, or USC. (I picked my alma mater, California.) For the rest of the online football season, every online point you score in the video game gets added to your team’s score. The team scores are tallied weekly, in order to determine the winner in a series of school vs. school matchups.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">These matchups perfectly mirror the real-world NCAA schedule. So, for example, the week that Oregon State faces Stanford in the real world, the two teams’ fans will compete online in five head-to-head video game challenges. The team that carries three of the five challenges is crowned the week’s online winner, regardless of who wins in the real world. That means plenty of online upsets, as fans of struggling teams rally to offset real losses with virtual victories.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">At the end of the year, the best-performing online teams compete in their own conference championships. The ultimate payoff is an <span class="italic">NCAA Football 10</span> National Championship video game played out the same week as the real-world National Championship game. In the words of EA Sports, “The national champion will be composed of the most dedicated fans playing <span class="italic">NCAA 10</span>.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">And that’s what makes every <span class="italic">NCAA Football 10</span> game more meaningful than other sports video games. You’re not just playing for yourself and for your own enjoyment. You’re publicly playing to show support for your real favorite team, as part of a collective, fan-wide effort.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">What’s so innovative about <span class="italic">NCAA Football 10</span> is the fact that the game is using reality itself as the larger context for individual player actions. It’s a fantasy league, but it’s a fantasy league wrapped in reality. It doesn’t have to invent a context from scratch to connect players to an epic story. Instead, it taps into existing college football narratives and traditions. It leverages existing communities, or fan bases, to provide meaningful social context. It feels epic because it’s directly connecting fans to a much bigger organization they care deeply about, but can’t ordinarily participate in directly.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">As much fun as it is to cheer on our favorite teams, it’s more meaningful to do something that pushes us to the edge of our own ability—and that counts, measurably. In <span class="italic">NCAA Football 10</span>, you’re not just playing <span class="italic">as</span> your favorite college team, you’re playing <span class="italic">in service of</span> your favorite college team. You’re actively contributing to their reputation in a way that is quantified and amplified by EA Sports. As one blogger puts it, “Every game you play will help your school’s cause.”<a id="filepos286035" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos943260" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">31</sup><br class="calibre3"/>31</a> It’s all about being of service to a larger cause—one you already care about.</span></div>
<div class="calibre4"><img alt="005" src="images/00006.jpg" class="calibre5"/></div><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">JOHAN HUIZINGA,</span> the great twentieth-century Dutch philosopher of human play, once said, “All play <span class="italic">means</span> something.”<a id="filepos286453" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos943635" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">32</sup><br class="calibre3"/>32</a> Today, thanks to the increased scale of game worlds and advances in collective game design, gameplay often means something <span class="italic">more</span>. Game developers today are honing their ability to create awe-inspiring contexts for collective effort and heroic service. As a result, game communities are more committed than ever to setting extreme-scale goals and generating epic meaning.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">When our everyday work feels trivial, or when we can’t easily be of direct service to a larger cause, games can fulfill an important need for us. As we play games at an epic scale, we’re increasing our ability to rise to the occasion, to inspire awe, and to take part in something bigger than ourselves.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Earlier in this chapter I quoted a <span class="italic">Halo</span> player who wondered, “Imagine what we could do with the full force of six billion humans!!”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Of course, there aren’t enough Xboxes in the world to do it. Nor could everyone afford them, of course. But it does make for an interesting thought experiment: What <span class="italic">could</span> you do in a game like <span class="italic">Halo 3</span> if you had the full force of humanity playing together?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">On one hand, this is an absurd idea to even consider. What would be the point of assembling 6 billion people to wage a fictional war?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">But on the other: can you imagine what it would feel like to have 6 billion people fighting <span class="italic">on the same side</span> of a fictional war?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">I think it’s pretty clear that such an effort would have real meaning, even if it failed to generate any real-world value. If you were able to focus the attention of the entire planet on a single goal, even if just for one day, and even if it just involved dispatching aliens in a video game, it would be a truly awe-inspiring occasion. It would be the single biggest collective experience ever undertaken in the whole of human history. It would give the whole earth goose bumps.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10"><span class="italic">That’s</span> the epic scale that gamers are capable of thinking on. That’s the scale gamers are ready to work at.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Gamers can imagine 6 billion people coming together to fight a fictional enemy, for the sheer awe and wonder of it. They are ready to work together on extreme scales, toward epic goals, just for the spine-tingling joy of it. And the more we seek out that kind of happiness as a planet, the more likely we are to save it—not from fictional aliens, but from apathy and wasted potential.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Jean M. Twenge, a professor of psychology and the author of <span class="italic">Generation Me</span>, has persuasively argued that the youngest generations today—particularly anyone born after 1980—are, in her words, “more miserable than ever before.” Why? Because of our increased cultural emphasis on “self-esteem” and “self-fulfillment.” But real fulfillment, as countless psychologists, philosophers, and spiritual leaders have shown, comes from fulfilling commitments to others. We want to be esteemed in the eyes of others, not for “who we are,” but rather for what we’ve done that really matters.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The more we focus on ourselves and avoid a commitment to others, Twenge’s research shows, the more we suffer from anxiety and depression. But that doesn’t stop us from trying to make ourselves happy alone. We mistakenly think that by putting ourselves first, we’ll finally get what we want. In fact, true happiness comes not from thinking <span class="italic">more</span> of ourselves, but rather from thinking <span class="italic">less</span> of ourselves—from seeing the truly small role we play in something much bigger, much more important than our individual needs.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Joining any collective effort and embracing feelings of awe can help us unlock our potential to lead a meaningful life and to leave a meaningful mark on the world.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Even if it’s a virtual world we’re leaving our mark on, we’re still learning what it feels like to be of service to a larger cause. We’re priming our brains and bodies to value and to seek out epic meaning as an emotional reward. And as recent research suggests, the more we enjoy these rewards in game worlds, the more likely we may be to seek them out in real life.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Three scientific studies published in 2009 by a consortium of researchers from eight universities in the United States, Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia studied the relationship between time spent playing games that require “helpful behavior” and the gamers’ willingness to help others in everyday life. One study focused on children age thirteen and younger, another on teenagers, and the third on college students. The researchers worked with more than three thousand young gamers in total, and in all three studies they reached the same conclusion: young people who spend more time playing games in which they’re required to help each other are significantly more likely to help friends, family, neighbors, and even strangers in their real lives.<a id="filepos291995" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos943829" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">33</sup><br class="calibre3"/>33</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Although these studies weren’t specifically looking at epic-scale games, the core findings seem likely to remain consistent, or even increase, at larger scales. As Brad Bushman, one coauthor of the studies and a professor of communications and psychology at the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, puts it, “These findings suggest there is an upward spiral of prosocial gaming and helpful behavior.”<a id="filepos292528" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos944231" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">34</sup><br class="calibre3"/>34</a> In other words, the more we help in games, the more we help in life. And so there’s good reason to believe that the more we learn to enjoy serving epic causes in game worlds, the more we may find ourselves contributing to epic efforts in the real world.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">THE PSYCHOLOGIST</span> Abraham Maslow famously said, “It isn’t normal to know what we want. It is a rare and difficult psychological achievement.”<a id="filepos293077" href="dummy_split_073.html#filepos944592" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">35</sup><br class="calibre3"/>35</a> But today’s best games give us a powerful tool for achieving exactly that rare kind of self-knowledge.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Games are showing us exactly what we want out of life: more satisfying work, better hope of success, stronger social connectivity, and the chance to be a part of something bigger than ourselves. With games that help us generate these four rewards every day, we have unlimited potential to raise our own quality of life. And when we play these games with friends, family, and neighbors, we can enrich the lives of people we care about.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">So games are teaching us to see what really makes us happy—and how to become the best versions of ourselves. But can we apply that knowledge to the real world?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">By supporting our four essential human cravings, and by providing a reliable source of flow and fiero, the gaming industry has gone a long way toward making us happier and more emotionally resilient—but only up to a point. We haven’t learned how to enjoy our <span class="italic">real lives</span> more thoroughly. Instead, we’ve spent the last thirty-five years learning to enjoy our <span class="italic">game lives</span> more thoroughly.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Instead of fixing reality, we’ve simply created more and more attractive alternatives to the boredom, anxiety, alienation, and meaninglessness we run up against so often in everyday life. It’s high time we start applying the lessons of games to the design of our everyday lives. We need to engineer <span class="italic">alternate</span> realities: new, more gameful ways of interacting with the real world and living our real lives.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Fortunately, the project of making alternate realities is already under way.</span></div>  <div class="mbppagebreak" id="calibre_pb_25"></div>
