<span class="bold1">THE DEMOCRATIC CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (DCAR)—THE REFUGEE STATE</span>
</span><br class="calibre13"/>
中非民主共和国ー难民国
</h2><div class="calibre6"> </div>
<div class="calibre25"><blockquote class="calibre21"><span class="calibre10"><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10">DCAR, the Democratic Central African Republic, is a “weakly statelike entity,” or WSLE, a 16 million person quasi-state entity in east central Africa in a contested region where the neighboring countries have largely lost the will to continue fighting but will not allow each other to declare victory.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Humanitarian efforts in this disordered area therefore had to provide many basic functions of the state, such as identity services, issuing what amounted to passports, issuing a basic electronic currency, and generally trying to keep life going until somebody asserted governance over the area.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Eventually, after four or five years of interim governance using electronic democracy software and biometric cell phones, DCAR has begun to have semiofficial, quasi-state status. Like Taiwan, it cannot safely assert full sovereignty, but the shells of the previous governments of the region have technically passed their legitimacy to the refugee councils of DCAR, and as long as nobody raises an army, nobody seems to mind self-organizing refugees trying to manage their lives until the governments settle their territorial disputes.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Anybody can support DCAR. You just have to remember how important it is that refugees get political rights to manage their own lives, just as we do. Being a refugee is hard enough without being oppressed too!</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">If you want to get more involved, display the DCAR flag wherever you can to let people know that DCAR still matters.</span></div>
</span></blockquote></div><div class="calibre8"> </div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The DCAR superstructure was founded by SEHI Hexayurt, or Vinay Gupta, a noted world expert on disaster relief. He is also the inventor of the Hexayurt, an inexpensive, lightweight shelter designed to provide sustainable housing for refugees. He wanted to address the Generation Exile superthreat in the context of the ongoing African refugee crisis. His SEHI mission: to help invent the future of peace and government.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">NONE OF THESE</span> ideas will reinvent the way the world works on its own. But alongside the more than five hundred other superstructures that players created, they effectively prove a new reality: that problem solving at extreme scales can involve ordinary people; that all scales of human organization can combine and recombine in startling ways; that continuous reinvention is not only possible, it’s an evolutionary imperative for the next decade.</span></div>
<div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre3"> <br class="calibre3"/></div><div class="calibre17"><span class="calibre10"><span class="bold1">WE RAN SUPERSTRUCT</span> as a live forecasting experiment for six weeks. So what were the final results?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">After the game, our players inventoried and organized their efforts into a catalog of solutions called the Whole Superstructure Catalog (a play on Stewart Brand’s <span class="italic">Whole Earth Catalog</span>), which you can view online, at Superstruct. <a href="http://wikia.com" class="calibre11">wikia.com<br class="calibre3"/>维基百科网站</a>.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In addition to their catalog of 550 superstructures, our players created more than a thousand vivid first-person accounts of the superthreats, told in videos and photos, blogs and Twitter updates, Facebook messages and podcasts. This world lives online as a resource for other forecasters, policy makers, educators, and interested individuals to explore and analyze.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">We set up traditional discussion forums to provide players with a sounding board for strategies they wanted to apply in their superstructures. The players held court across more than five hundred different forum topics, such as “Networking the offline world: How do we reach out to people who aren’t online?”; “What can we do with bicycles: Beyond exercise, how can we use bicycles to help solve some big problems?”; and “Art for art’s sake: What is the role of arts in 2019? What role can art play during times of epic crisis?” There’s enough reading material on these forums to comprise dozens of future-forecasting reports—and it’s all saved online for public browsing.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">In terms of gameplay, we had nineteen players achieve a survivability score of 100—the equivalent of winning the staff of life in <span class="italic">Spore</span>, or creating a level 80 character in <span class="italic">World of Warcraft</span>. We invited these nineteen players to become our “SEHI 19,” and we extended invitations to them to continue collaborating with the Institute for the Future. All of the players, but in particular the SEHI 19, became a kind of superstructure for IFTF itself.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Finally, our Ten-Year Forecast team spent six months analyzing the results of the forecasting game. We prepared the year’s TYF research report, “Superstructing the Next Decade,” developing the themes explored in our scenario and analyzing the most promising superstructing methods demonstrated by our players. We’ve since made these materials—including a set of “Superstruct strategy cards,” a visual map of the Superstruct ecosystem, and three alternate scenarios for the next fifty years of planet craft—available to the public on the Institute for the Future’s website.<a id="filepos814548" href="dummy_split_082.html#filepos990722" class="calibre11"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre27">27</sup><br class="calibre3"/>27</a></span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Oh, and just in case you’re wondering—how much good did our players collectively do, according to the game’s Global Extinction Awareness System?</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">By the end of the six-week game, the players had pushed the survival horizon for the human species to the year 2086—or one year more for every thousand survivability points they collectively earned. That’s forty-four more years they earned us on this planet—enough time for two more generations of potential super-empowered hopeful individuals to be born and to start working on these problems with us.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">The entire experience is perhaps best summed up by a Twitter post from one of our players. It epitomizes exactly what IFTF hoped to accomplish with the game.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">“This is my favorite vision of the future, ever,” he wrote. “Because it’s the first one I feel personally capable of making a difference in.”</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Superstruct was designed to wake gamers up to the possibility of making the future together—a critical first step to increasing our collective engagement with global superthreats. But to produce real change in the world, it’s not enough to spread a feeling of super-empowerment and hope. We also have to build up actual world-changing capacity among gamers. We have to help them cultivate the specific future-making skills and abilities, and acquire the practical knowledge they need, in order to increase their chances of making a real and sustained difference.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">Super-empowered hope and collaborative creativity must be combined with <span class="italic">practical learning</span> and <span class="italic">real capacity development</span>. And it can’t just happen in the parts of the world where computer and video game technology is already pervasive. World-changing games must be custom designed specifically for the most impoverished regions of the world, where future-making skills are most urgently needed—for example, developing areas in much of Africa.</span></div>
<div class="calibre26"><span class="calibre10">These are the two key insights that led me to my most recent game, EVOKE.</span></div>
