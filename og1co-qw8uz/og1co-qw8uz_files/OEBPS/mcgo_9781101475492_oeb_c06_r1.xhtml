<div class="fmht"><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER SIX</b></div>
<div class="fmht"><b class="calibre5">Becoming a Part of Something Bigger Than Ourselves</b></div>
<div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">I</b>n April 2009, <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i> players celebrated a collective spine-tingling milestone: 10 billion kills against their virtual enemy, the Covenant. That’s roughly one and a half times the total number of every man, woman, and child on earth.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To reach this monumental milestone, <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i> players spent 565 days fighting the third and final campaign in the fictional Great War, protecting earth from an alliance of malevolent aliens seeking to destroy the human race. Together, they averaged 17.5 million Covenant kills a day, 730,000 kills per hour, 12,000 kills a minute.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Along the way, they’d assembled the largest army on earth, virtual or otherwise. More than 15 million people had fought on behalf of the science fiction game’s United Nations Space Command. That’s roughly the total number of active personnel of all twenty-five of the largest armed forces in the real world, combined.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en132" id="Ref-en132"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">1</sup><br class="calibre2"/>1</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Ten billion kills wasn’t an incidental achievement, stumbled onto blindly by the gaming masses. <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> players made a concerted effort to get there. They embraced 10 billion kills as a symbol of just how much the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> community could accomplish—and they wanted it to be something bigger than anything any other game community had achieved before. So they worked  hard to make every single player as good at <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> 3 as possible. Players shared tips and strategies with each other and organized round-the-clock “co-op,” or cooperative, campaign shifts. They called on every registered member of <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> online to pitch in: “This could be something big, but we will need YOU to get it done.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en133" id="Ref-en133"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">2</sup><br class="calibre2"/>2</a> They treated their mission like an urgent duty. “We know we’ll be doing our part,” one game blog declared. “Will you?”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en134" id="Ref-en134"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">3</sup><br class="calibre2"/>3</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s no wonder London <i class="calibre6">Telegraph</i> reporter Sam Leith observed in his coverage of the <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i> community that “a big shift has taken place, in recent years, in the way video games are played. What was once generally a solitary activity is now . . . overwhelmingly a communal one.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en135" id="Ref-en135"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">4</sup><br class="calibre2"/>4</a> More and more, gamers aren’t just in it for themselves. They’re in it for each other—and for the thrill of being a part of something bigger.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">When <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> players finally reached their goal, they flooded online forums to congratulate each other and claim their contributions. “I just did some math and with my 32,388 kills I have .00032% of the 10 billion kills,” one player wrote. “I feel like I could have contributed more . . . well, on to 100 billion then!”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en136" id="Ref-en136"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">5</sup><br class="calibre2"/>5</a> This reaction was typical, and the new 100 billion goal was repeated widely on <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> forums. Fresh off one collective achievement, <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> players were ready to tackle an even more monumental goal. And they were fully prepared to recruit an even bigger community to do it. As one gamer proposed: “We did that with just a few million gamers. Imagine what we could do with the full force of six billion humans!!”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en137" id="Ref-en137"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">6</sup><br class="calibre2"/>6</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3"><i class="calibre6">Halo</i>’s creators, a Seattle, Washington-based game studio called Bungie, joined in the celebration. They issued a major press release and an open letter to the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> community, emphasizing the teamwork it had taken to get to 10 billion kills: “We’ve hit the Covenant where it hurts. Made them pay a price for setting foot on our soil. We’re glad we’ve got you by our side, soldier. Mighty fine work. Here’s to ten billion more.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en138" id="Ref-en138"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">7</sup><br class="calibre2"/>7</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Perhaps you’re thinking to yourself right now: <i class="calibre6">So?</i> What’s the point? The Covenant isn’t real. It’s just a game. What have the players actually <i class="calibre6">done</i> that’s worth celebrating?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">On one hand, nothing. There’s no <i class="calibre6">value</i> to a Covenant kill, whether you score one, 10 billion, or even 100 billion of them. Value is a measure of importance  and consequence. And even the most die-hard <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> fan knows that there’s no real importance or consequence to saving the human race from a fictional alien invasion. There’s no actual danger being averted. There are no real lives being saved.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But on the other hand, just because the kills don’t have value doesn’t mean they don’t have <i class="calibre6">meaning</i>.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Meaning is the feeling that we’re a part of something bigger than ourselves. It’s the belief that our actions matter beyond our own individual lives. When something is meaningful, it has significance and worth not just to ourselves, or even to our closest friends and family, but to a much larger group: to a community, an organization, or even the entire human species.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Meaning is something we’re all looking for more of: more ways to make a difference in the bigger picture, more chances to leave a lasting mark on the world, more moments of awe and wonder at the scale of the projects and communities we’re a part of.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">How do we get more meaning in our lives? It’s actually quite simple. Philosophers, psychologists, and spiritual leaders agree: the single best way to add meaning to our lives is to <i class="calibre6">connect our daily actions to something bigger than ourselves</i>—and the bigger, the better. As Martin Seligman says, “The self is a very poor site for meaning.” We can’t <i class="calibre6">matter</i> outside of a large-scale social context. “The larger the entity you can attach yourself to,” Seligman advises, “the more meaning you can derive.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en139" id="Ref-en139"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">8</sup><br class="calibre2"/>8</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">And that’s exactly the point of working together in a game like <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i>. It’s not that the Covenant kills have value. It’s that pursuing a massive goal alongside millions of other people feels good. It feels meaningful. When players dedicate themselves to a goal like 10 billion Covenant kills, they’re attaching themselves to a cause, and they’re making a significant contribution to it. As the popular gamer site Joystiq reported on the day <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> players celebrated their 10 billionth kill: “Now we know for sure.... Every kill you get in <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i>’s campaign actually <i class="calibre6">means</i> something.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en140" id="Ref-en140"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">9</sup><br class="calibre2"/>9</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">To experience <i class="calibre6">real</i> meaning, we don’t have to contribute something of <i class="calibre6">real</i> value. We just have to be given the opportunity to contribute at all. We need a way to connect with others who care about the same massively scaled goal  we do, no matter how arbitrary the goal. And we need a chance to reflect on the truly epic scale of what we’re doing together.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Which gives us our sixth fix for our broken reality:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">FIX #6: EPIC SCALE</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">Compared with games, reality is trivial. Games make us a part of something bigger and give epic meaning to our actions.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">“Epic” is the key word here. Blockbuster video games like <i class="calibre6">Halo</i>—the kind of games that have a production budget of thirty, forty or even fifty million dollars—aren’t just “something bigger.” They’re big enough to be <i class="calibre6">epic</i>.</div>
<div class="fmtx3"><b class="calibre5">Epic</b> is one of the most important concepts in gamer culture today. It’s how players describe their most memorable, gratifying game experiences. As one game critic writes, “<i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i> is epic. It empowers you the way no other game can. It doesn’t have moments, but events. Experiences that tickle the soul, sending shivers down the spine<i class="calibre6">.</i>”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en141" id="Ref-en141"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">10</sup><br class="calibre2"/>10</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">A good working definition for “epic” is something that far surpasses the ordinary, especially in size, scale, and intensity. Something epic is of <i class="calibre6">heroic proportions</i>. Blockbuster video games do epic scale better than any other medium of our time, and they’re epic in three key ways:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">They create <i class="calibre6">epic contexts for action</i>: collective stories that help us connect our individual gameplay to a much bigger mission.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx1">They immerse us in <i class="calibre6">epic environments</i>: vast, interactive spaces that provoke feelings of curiosity and wonder.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx1">And they engage us in <i class="calibre6">epic projects</i>: cooperative efforts carried out by players on massive scales, over months or even years.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">There’s a reason why gamers love epic games. It’s not just that bigger is better. It’s that bigger is more awe-inspiring.</div>
<div class="fmtx3"><b class="calibre5">Awe</b> is a unique emotion. According to many positive psychologists, it’s the single most overwhelming and gratifying positive emotion we can feel. In fact, neuropsychologist Paul Pearsall calls awe “the orgasm of positive emotions.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en142" id="Ref-en142"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">11</sup><br class="calibre2"/>11</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Awe is what we feel when we recognize that we’re in the presence of something bigger than ourselves. It’s closely linked with feelings of spirituality, love, and gratitude—and more importantly, a desire to serve.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In <i class="calibre6">Born to Be Good</i>, Dacher Keltner explains, “The experience of awe is about finding your place in the larger scheme of things. It is about quieting the press of self-interest. It is about folding into social collectives. It is about feeling reverential toward participating in some expansive process that unites us all and that ennobles our life’s endeavors.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en143" id="Ref-en143"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">12</sup><br class="calibre2"/>12</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">In other words, awe doesn’t just <i class="calibre6">feel</i> good; it inspires us to <i class="calibre6">do</i> good.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Without a doubt, it’s awe that a <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i> player is feeling when he says that the game sends “shivers down the spine.” Spine tingling is one of the classic physiological symptoms of awe—along with chills, goose bumps, and that choked-up feeling in the throat.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Our ability to feel awe in the form of chills, goose bumps, or choking up serves as a kind of emotional radar for detecting meaningful activity. Whenever we feel awe, we know we’ve found a potential source of meaning. We’ve discovered a real opportunity to be of service, to band together, to contribute to a larger cause.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In short, awe is a call to collective action.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So it’s no accident that <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> players are so inclined toward collective efforts. It’s the direct result of the game’s epic, and awe-inspiring, aesthetic. Today’s best game designers are experts at giving individuals the chance to be a part of something bigger—and no one is better at it than the creators of <i class="calibre6">Halo</i>. Everything about the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> games—from the plot and the sound track to the marketing and the way the community is organized online—is intentionally crafted to make players feel that their gameplay really means something. And the one  simple trick used over and over again is this: always connect the individual to something bigger.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Let’s take a closer look at exactly how <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> does it.</div>
<div class="calibre2"><a id="h1"><br class="calibre2"/></a></div>
<h1 class="h"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Epic Context for Heroic Action</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
英雄行动的史诗背景</h1>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx1"><i class="calibre6">It’s five hundred years in the future. The Covenant, a hostile alliance of alien species, is hell-bent on destroying humanity. You are Master Chief Petty Officer John 117—once an ordinary person, now a supersoldier, augmented with biological technologies that give you superhuman speed, strength, intelligence, vision, and reflexes. Your job is to stop the Covenant and save the world.</i></div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">That’s the basic <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> story. It’s not that different from many other blockbuster video games. As veteran game developer Trent Polack puts it, “To look at the majority of games today, one might think that gamers care only about saving the world.” He would know: some of Polack’s previous games have asked players to save the galaxy from malevolent aliens (<i class="calibre6">Galactic Civilizations II</i>), save the universe from evil deities (<i class="calibre6">Demigod</i>), and save the world from marauding Titans (<i class="calibre6">Elemental: War of Magic</i>).</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Why <i class="calibre6">are</i> so many games about saving the world? In an industry article about the rise of “epic scale” narratives in video games, Polack suggests, “When games give players the epic scope of saving the galaxy, destroying some reawakened ancient evil, or any other classical portrayal of good versus evil on a grand scale, they’re fulfilling gamers’ power fantasies.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en144" id="Ref-en144"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">13</sup><br class="calibre2"/>13</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">I agree with Polack, but it’s important that we be clear on exactly what <i class="calibre6">kind</i> of power fantasy is being fulfilled by these save-the-world stories.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Any video game that features a slew of high-powered weapons and game-play that consists largely of shooting and blowing things up is, at one level, about the aesthetic pleasures of destruction and the positive feelings we get from exerting control over a situation.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en145" id="Ref-en145"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">14</sup><br class="calibre2"/>14</a> This is true of any shooter game on  the market today. But we don’t need an epic story about saving the world to get those pleasures. We can get them quite effectively, and more efficiently, from a simple, plotless game like Atari’s <i class="calibre6">Breakout</i>. Games that come with epic, save-the-world narratives are using them to help players get a taste of a different kind of power. It’s the power to act with meaning: to do something that matters in a bigger picture. The story is the bigger picture; the player’s actions are what matters.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As Polack explains, “Story sets the stage for meaning. It frames the player’s actions. We, as designers, are not telling, we’re not showing, we’re informing the <i class="calibre6">doing</i>—the actions that players engage in and the feats they undergo.” These feats make up the player’s story, and the story is ultimately what has meaning.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Not every game feels like a larger cause. For a game to feel like a <i class="calibre6">cause</i>, two things need to happen. First, the game’s story needs to become a <b class="calibre5">collective context</b> for action—shared by other players, not just an individual experience. That’s why truly epic games are always attached to large, online player communities—hundreds of thousands or millions of players acting in the same context together, and talking to each other on forums and wikis about the actions they’re taking. And second, the actions that players take inside the collective context need to feel like <b class="calibre5">service:</b> every effort by one player must ultimately benefit all the other players. In other words, every individual act of gameplay has to eventually add up to something bigger.</div>
<div class="fmtx3"><i class="calibre6">Halo</i> is probably the best game in the world at turning a story into a collective context and making personal achievement feel like service.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Like many other blockbuster video games, <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> has extensive online community features: discussion forums, wikis, and file sharing (so that players can upload and share videos of their finest gameplay moments). But Bungie and Xbox have taken it much further than these traditional context-building tools. They’ve given players groundbreaking tools for tracking the magnitude of their collective effort and unprecedented opportunities to reflect on the epic scale of their collective service.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Every <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> player has their own story of making a difference, and it’s documented  online in their “personal service record.” It’s an exhaustive record and analysis of their individual contributions to the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> community and to the Great War effort—or as Bungie calls it, “Your entire <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> career.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The service record is stored on the official Bungie website, and it’s fully viewable by other players. It lists all the campaign levels you’ve completed, the medals you’ve earned, and the achievements you’ve unlocked. It also includes a minute-by-minute, play-by-play breakdown of <i class="calibre6">every single</i> Halo <i class="calibre6">level or match you’ve ever played online</i>. For many <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> players, that means thousands of games over the past six years—ever since the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> series first went online in 2004—all laid out and perfectly documented in one place.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">And it’s more than just statistics. There are data visualizations of every possible kind: interactive charts, graphs, heat maps. They help you learn about your own strengths and weaknesses: where you make the most mistakes, and where you consistently score your biggest victories; which weapons you’re most proficient with, and which you’re weakest with; even which teammates help you play better, and which don’t.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Thanks to Bungie’s exhaustive data collection and sharing, everything you do in <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> adds up to something bigger: a multiyear history of your own personal service to the Great War.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But it’s not just your history—it’s much bigger than that. You’re contributing to the Great War effort alongside millions of other players, who also have service records online. And <i class="calibre6">service</i> really is a crucial concept here. A personal service record isn’t just a profile. It’s a history of a player’s contributions to a larger organization. The fact that your profile is called a “service record” is a constant reminder. When you play <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> online, rack up kills, and accomplish your missions, you’re <i class="calibre6">contributing</i>. You’re actively creating new moments in the history of the Great War.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en146" id="Ref-en146"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">15</sup><br class="calibre2"/>15岁</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">The moments all add up. The millions of individual personal service records taken together tell the real story of <i class="calibre6">Halo</i>, a collective history of the Great War. They connect all the individual gamers into a community, a network of people fighting for the same cause. And the unprecedented scale of data collected and shared in these service records underscores just how epic the players’ collective story is. Bungie recently announced to players that its  personal-service-record servers handled more than 1.4 <i class="calibre6">quadrillion</i> bytes of data requests from players in the past nine months. That’s 1.4 petabytes in computer science terms.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To put that number in perspective, experts have estimated that the entire written works of humankind, from the beginning of recorded history, in all languages, adds up to about 50 petabytes of data.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en147" id="Ref-en147"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">16</sup><br class="calibre2"/>16岁</a> <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> players aren’t quite there yet—but it’s not a bad start, considering that they’ve been playing together online for only six short years, compared to all of recorded human history.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">One of the best examples of innovative collective context building is the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> Museum of Humanity, an online museum that purports to be from the twenty-seventh century, dedicated to “all who fought bravely in the Great War.” Of course, it’s not a real museum; it was developed by the Xbox marketing group to build a more meaningful context for <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i>.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The museum features a series of videos done in the classic style of Ken Burns’ <i class="calibre6">Civil War</i> series: interviews with Great War veterans and historians, images from Covenant battles, all set to a hymnal score. As one blogger wrote, “The videos in the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> Museum of Humanity seem like they could have been pulled straight from The History Channel.... It’s nice to see video game lore treated with this kind of reverence.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en148" id="Ref-en148"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">17</sup><br class="calibre2"/>17</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Reverence—the expression of profound awe, respect and love, or veneration—is usually an emotion we reserve for very big, very serious things. But that was precisely the point of the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> Museum of Humanity: to acknowledge how seriously <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> players take their favorite game, and to inspire the kind of epic emotions that have always been the best part of playing it.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s worked. The video series packs a real emotional wallop, despite the fact that, in the words of one player, “it’s meant to honor heroes that never existed.” <a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en149" id="Ref-en149"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">18</sup><br class="calibre2"/>18岁</a> Brian Crecente, a leading games journalist, wrote, “It left me with chills.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en150" id="Ref-en150"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">19</sup><br class="calibre2"/>19</a> And online forums and blogs were full of comments expressing heart-felt emotion. One player put it best when he wrote, “Really poignant. They’ve made something real out of fiction.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en151" id="Ref-en151"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">20</sup><br class="calibre2"/>20</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s not that the museum is such a believable artifact from the future. It’s that the <i class="calibre6">emotions</i> it provokes are believable. The online Museum of Humanity  is a place to reflect on the extreme scale of the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> experience: the years of service, the millions of players involved. The Great War isn’t real, but you really do feel awe when you think about the scale of the effort so many different people have made to fight it.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In the end, as one player sums it up, “<i class="calibre6">Halo</i> proves that you can have a shooter game with a story that really means something. It draws you in and makes you feel like you’re part of something bigger.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en152" id="Ref-en152"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">21</sup><br class="calibre2"/>二十一岁</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">But <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> isn’t just a bigger story. It’s also a bigger environment—and this brings us to our next strategy for connecting players to something bigger: built epic environments, or highly immersive spaces that are intentionally designed to bring out the best in us.</div>
<div class="calibre2"><a id="h2"><br class="calibre2"/></a></div>
<h1 class="h"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Epic Environments—Or How to Build a Better Place</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
史诗般的环境ーー或如何建造一个更美好的地方</h1>
<div class="fmtx">An epic environment is a space that, by virtue of its extreme scale, provokes a profound sense of awe and wonder.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">There are plenty of natural epic environments in the world: Mount Everest, the Grand Canyon, Victoria Falls, the Great Barrier Reef, for example. These spaces humble us; they remind us of the power and grandeur of nature, and make us feel small by comparison.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">A <i class="calibre6">built</i> epic environment is different: it’s not the work of nature, but rather a feat of design and engineering. It’s a <i class="calibre6">human</i> accomplishment. And that makes it both humbling and empowering at the same time. It makes us feel smaller as individuals, but it also makes us feel capable of much bigger things, together. That’s because a built epic environment—like the Great Wall of China, the Taj Mahal, or Machu Picchu—is the result of extreme-scale collaboration. It’s proof of the extraordinary scale of things humans can accomplish together.</div>
<div class="fmtx3"><i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i> is, without a doubt, such an environment.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The game consists of thirty-four different playing environments spanning more than two hundred thousand light-years of virtual space. From one level to the next, you might find yourself traveling from the crowded market city of  Voi, Kenya, to the Ark, a desert far, far beyond the limits of our own Milky Way galaxy.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s not just how big the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> playing field is; it’s also how diverse and carefully rendered the environments are. As Sam Leith observes, “The building of a game like <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i> is a work of electronic engineering comparable in scale to the building of a medieval cathedral.” It took Bungie three years to craft this gaming cathedral, with a team of more than 250 artists, designers, writers, programmers, and engineers collaborating together. “You get a sense of the scale and intricacy of the task,” Leith continues, “by considering the sound effects alone: The game contains 54,000 pieces of audio and 40,000 lines of dialogue. There are 2,700 different noises for footsteps alone, depending on whose foot is stepping on what.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en153" id="Ref-en153"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">22</sup><br class="calibre2"/>22</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">And that’s what players are appreciating when they get goose bumps from <i class="calibre6">Halo</i>: the unprecedented achievement it represents as a work of computer design and engineering. Gamers aren’t so much in awe of the environment itself as they are in awe of the work and dedication and vision required to create it. In this regard, <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> players join a long tradition in human culture of feeling awe, wonder, and gratitude toward the builders of epic environments.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">THE VERY FIRST</b> epic environments were constructed more than eleven thousand years ago, during the Neolithic period, or the New Stone Age. In other words, six thousand years before humans first used the written word, they were already building physical spaces to inspire awe and cooperation.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The world’s oldest known example of an epic built environment is the Gobekli Tepe. Discovered less than two decades ago in southeastern Turkey, it’s believed to predate Stonehenge by a staggering six thousand years. It’s a twenty-five-acre arrangement of at least twenty stone circles, between ten and thirty meters in diameter each, made from monolithic pillars three meters high.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In comparison with other stone houses, tombs, and temples from the same period and location, this building was constructed on an extreme scale: it was much, <i class="calibre6">much</i> bigger, taller, and more formidable in its design than anything archaeologists had seen before at the time of its discovery. One archaeologist  on the scene described it as “a place of worship on an unprecedented scale—humanity’s first ‘cathedral on a hill.’”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en154" id="Ref-en154"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">23</sup><br class="calibre2"/>23</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">And it wasn’t just the scale of the building—it was its particular winding design. The Gobekli Tepe features an intricate series of passageways that would lead visitors through the dark to a cross-shaped inner sanctum, almost like a labyrinth. This particular architecture seems designed intentionally to trigger interest and curiosity, alongside a kind of trembling wonder. What would be around the next corner? Where would the path take them? They would need to hold on to other visitors for support, feeling their way through the darkness.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Crucially, the Gobekli Tepe wasn’t an isolated example. As researchers have discovered since, epic stone cathedrals were common across the Neolithic landscape. Most recently, in August 2009, archaeologists working in northern Scotland unearthed the ruins of a 5,330-square-foot stone structure with twenty-foot ceilings and sixteen-foot-thick walls, also of a labyrinthine design, and also dating back to the New Stone Age.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en155" id="Ref-en155"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">24</sup><br class="calibre2"/>24</a> “A building of this scale and complexity was here to amaze, to create a sense of awe in the people who saw this place,” Nick Card, director of the archaeological dig, said to reporters when the ancient cathedral was first unearthed.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In the wake of unearthing these types of structures all over the planet, archaeologists have recently proposed a startling theory: that these stone cathedrals served an important purpose in the evolution of human civilization. They actually inspired and enabled human society to become dramatically more cooperative, completely reinventing civilization as it once existed. In an in-depth report in <i class="calibre6">Smithsonian</i> magazine on these Neolithic cathedrals, Andrew Curry wrote:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">Scholars have long believed that only after people learned to farm and live in settled communities did they have the time, organization and resources to construct temples and support complicated social structures. But . . . [perhaps] it was the other way around: the extensive, coordinated effort to build the monoliths literally laid the groundwork for the development of complex societies.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en156" id="Ref-en156"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">25</sup><br class="calibre2"/>25</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In fact, as Curry quotes one scientist in his article, “You can make a good case these constructs are the real origin of complex Neolithic societies.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en157" id="Ref-en157"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">26</sup><br class="calibre2"/>26</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">No wonder epic environments inspire gamers today to collective efforts. They have been inspiring humans to work together to do amazing things for eleven thousand years and counting.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">SO VIDEO GAMES</b> didn’t invent epic environment design. They inherited the tradition from some of our earliest ancestors. But they <i class="calibre6">are</i> making epic environments remarkably more accessible, to vastly more people, on a daily basis.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Archaeologists say that worshippers would have traveled more than a hundred miles by foot to visit the Gobekli Tepe, and they may have visited it just once in a lifetime. Today, however, it’s easy to immerse ourselves in epic environments whenever we want. Instead of traveling great distances for a single encounter with a physical cathedral, we can instantly transport ourselves there from anywhere in the world, simply by loading up a blockbuster video game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Our experience of these epic game environments isn’t physical, but it is real in one crucial sense. The engineering of the virtual environment represents, today, a collaborative feat on an extreme scale. It takes an extraordinary collective and coordinated effort to create these virtual worlds—years of full-time, painstaking work by hundreds of artists and programmers—and the first time a gamer enters one of these massive environments, they are experiencing real awe at the ability of ordinary people, when they band together, to create extraordinary spaces.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Meanwhile, video game developers have evolved the art of epic built environments in another key way: they have added a layer of awe-inspiring sound.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The sound track isn’t just part of the background of playing; it’s a major component of the gaming experience—particularly in the case of <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> and its famously spine-tingling score. Tracks on the <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i> sound track have names like “Honorable Intentions,” “This Is the Hour,” and “Never Forget.” Perhaps my favorite track is called simply “Ambient Wonder,” a name that perfectly sums up the purpose of an epic environment: to create a space that completely absorbs and envelops the player in a sense of awe and wonder.</div>
<div class="fmtx3"><i class="calibre6">Halo</i>’s audio director, Martin O’Donnell, describes his goal in creating the score: “The music should give a feeling of importance, weight, and sense of the ‘ancient’ to the visuals of <i class="calibre6">Halo</i>.” The score includes Gregorian chanting, a string orchestra, percussion, and Qawwali vocals, a Sufi devotional style of music intended to produce an ecstatic state in the listener.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en158" id="Ref-en158"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">27</sup><br class="calibre2"/>27</a> These are timeless musical techniques for provoking our bodies’ epic emotions—and video games increasingly make use of them. As one <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> player explains, “A great video game will make the hairs stand up on the back of your neck. Goose pimples will erupt. That tingly sensation overtakes your gut. It happens to me whenever I hear the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> sound track.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en159" id="Ref-en159"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">28</sup><br class="calibre2"/>28</a></div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">SO WHAT DO</b> all of these extreme visual and audio environments add up to? Epic projects: collaborative efforts to tell stories and accomplish missions at extreme scales.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Epic environments inspire us to undertake epic projects, because they are a tangible demonstration of what is humanly possible when we all work together. Indeed, they <i class="calibre6">expand</i> our notion of what is humanly possible. And that’s why exploring an epic environment like <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i> inspires the kind of emotions that lead to large-scale cooperation, an epic achievement in and of itself.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Games journalist Margaret Robertson reflects, “<i class="calibre6">Halo</i> has always been a place where I feel good. I don’t mean that in a James Brown sense. I mean it’s a place where I feel virtuous.... [It] engenders a sense of honour and duty which actually make you feel like a better person.... What’s the point of going to a better place if you aren’t going to be a better person?”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en160" id="Ref-en160"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">29</sup><br class="calibre2"/>29</a></div>
<div class="calibre2"><a id="h3"><br class="calibre2"/></a></div>
<h1 class="h"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Epic Projects</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
史诗计划</h1>
<div class="fmtx">While reaching the 10 billion kill milestone was a significant community achievement, <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> players have actually spent more time working on two other epic projects—both collaborative knowledge projects. The first epic project involves documenting the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> world on wikis and discussion forums.  The other is a project to build up each other’s collective ability to fight the Covenant and play a better game with each other. Both projects take place largely on discussion forums and wikis.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To give you an indication of the scale of the collective effort to document the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> world and improve player ability within it, players have written more than 21 million discussion forum posts on the official Bungie <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> forums alone. Meanwhile, the largest <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> wiki has just under six thousand different articles, created and edited by 1.5 million registered users.</div>
<div class="fmtx3"><i class="calibre6">Halo</i> players are also sharing knowledge to make each other better gamers. While the Halopedia wiki helps players construct the epic saga of the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> series, the Halowiki (which describes itself as a “sister site” to Halopedia) focuses exclusively on multiplayer strategy and techniques. Its “values” statement sets the tone for epic knowledge sharing:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">This site serves one purpose: <a href="http://Halowiki.net">Halowiki.net<br class="calibre2"/>Halowiki. net</a> shall help players at all skill levels improve and/or find even more enjoyment in their <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i> online experience. Share what you know. Let others share what they know with you. We must get even the most skilled players to share their knowledge. The end result shall be that we all raise our skills and fun together. Let’s try to visit the limits of our abilities!<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en161" id="Ref-en161"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">30</sup><br class="calibre2"/>30</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The scope of Halowiki is as staggering as its sister site. Under the tips section alone, there is an A to Z catalog of more than 150 different categories of tips, from “Bad habits to avoid in team games” and “Communication tips,” to “How to use vehicles effectively” and “Last-resort tips when all else fails.” Each individual category of tips contains hundreds of specific pieces of advice, contributed by different gamers.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The strategy section, on the other hand, contains more complex advice, sorted into roughly one hundred different categories, from “Close-range weapon mastery” and “Using ancient practices—advice from Sun Tzu’s <i class="calibre6">The Art of War</i>,” to one of my personal favorites: “Retraining your brain to not be afraid to die in the game.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In total, there are more than one thousand different sections on Halowiki that compile players’ firsthand knowledge playing the game into a collective intelligence resource. Ultimately, for members of the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> community, this resource serves a greater purpose than just creating better <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> players. Adding a bit of knowledge to the wiki validates that you know at least one thing that matters to millions of other people. It might be just a bit of <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> trivia—but there’s nothing trivial about the positive feeling you get when you make a contribution that millions of other people can value and appreciate.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6"><b class="calibre5">HALO</b></i> <b class="calibre5">HAS CONSISTENTLY</b> pushed the limits of epic game design for a decade now—the first game in the series was released in 2001. But plenty of other online games are doing their part to invent new ways for gamers to become a part of something bigger. One of the most interesting recent experiments in epic game design is a project called Season Showdown, developed by EA Sports for its best-selling college football series <i class="calibre6">NCAA Football</i>. Season Showdown is the first significant effort in the sports video game genre—a highly successful genre, representing more than 15 percent of all game sales—to create the same kinds of epic emotional rewards more traditionally associated with save-the-world games like <i class="calibre6">Halo</i>.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">“Every Game Counts” is the tagline for <i class="calibre6">NCAA Football 10.</i> Of course, this begs the question: counts toward what? The short answer is: every game played counts toward a national championship. It’s not the real national championship, but not an entirely virtual one, either.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">When you sign up to play <i class="calibre6">NCAA Football 10</i> online, the first thing you do is declare a team allegiance. You can pick any one of the 120 real-world college teams represented in the game, from Ohio State, Notre Dame, or Stanford to Florida State, Army, or USC. (I picked my alma mater, California.) For the rest of the online football season, every online point you score in the video game gets added to your team’s score. The team scores are tallied weekly, in order to determine the winner in a series of school vs. school matchups.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">These matchups perfectly mirror the real-world NCAA schedule. So, for example, the week that Oregon State faces Stanford in the real world, the two teams’ fans will compete online in five head-to-head video game challenges. The team that carries three of the five challenges is crowned the week’s online winner, regardless of who wins in the real world. That means plenty of online upsets, as fans of struggling teams rally to offset real losses with virtual victories.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">At the end of the year, the best-performing online teams compete in their own conference championships. The ultimate payoff is an <i class="calibre6">NCAA Football 10</i> National Championship video game played out the same week as the real-world National Championship game. In the words of EA Sports, “The national champion will be composed of the most dedicated fans playing <i class="calibre6">NCAA 10</i>.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">And that’s what makes every <i class="calibre6">NCAA Football 10</i> game more meaningful than other sports video games. You’re not just playing for yourself and for your own enjoyment. You’re publicly playing to show support for your real favorite team, as part of a collective, fan-wide effort.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">What’s so innovative about <i class="calibre6">NCAA Football 10</i> is the fact that the game is using reality itself as the larger context for individual player actions. It’s a fantasy league, but it’s a fantasy league wrapped in reality. It doesn’t have to invent a context from scratch to connect players to an epic story. Instead, it taps into existing college football narratives and traditions. It leverages existing communities, or fan bases, to provide meaningful social context. It feels epic because it’s directly connecting fans to a much bigger organization they care deeply about, but can’t ordinarily participate in directly.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As much fun as it is to cheer on our favorite teams, it’s more meaningful to do something that pushes us to the edge of our own ability—and that counts, measurably. In <i class="calibre6">NCAA Football 10</i>, you’re not just playing <i class="calibre6">as</i> your favorite college team, you’re playing <i class="calibre6">in service of</i> your favorite college team. You’re actively contributing to their reputation in a way that is quantified and amplified by EA Sports. As one blogger puts it, “Every game you play will help your school’s cause.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en162" id="Ref-en162"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">31</sup><br class="calibre2"/>31</a> It’s all about being of service to a larger cause—one you already care about.</div>
<div class="centeraligned"><img alt="005" class="imgepub1" src="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_005_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">JOHAN HUIZINGA,</b> the great twentieth-century Dutch philosopher of human play, once said, “All play <i class="calibre6">means</i> something.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en163" id="Ref-en163"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">32</sup><br class="calibre2"/>32</a> Today, thanks to the increased scale of game worlds and advances in collective game design, gameplay often means something <i class="calibre6">more</i>. Game developers today are honing their ability to create awe-inspiring contexts for collective effort and heroic service. As a result, game communities are more committed than ever to setting extreme-scale goals and generating epic meaning.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">When our everyday work feels trivial, or when we can’t easily be of direct service to a larger cause, games can fulfill an important need for us. As we play games at an epic scale, we’re increasing our ability to rise to the occasion, to inspire awe, and to take part in something bigger than ourselves.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Earlier in this chapter I quoted a <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> player who wondered, “Imagine what we could do with the full force of six billion humans!!”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Of course, there aren’t enough Xboxes in the world to do it. Nor could everyone afford them, of course. But it does make for an interesting thought experiment: What <i class="calibre6">could</i> you do in a game like <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i> if you had the full force of humanity playing together?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">On one hand, this is an absurd idea to even consider. What would be the point of assembling 6 billion people to wage a fictional war?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But on the other: can you imagine what it would feel like to have 6 billion people fighting <i class="calibre6">on the same side</i> of a fictional war?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">I think it’s pretty clear that such an effort would have real meaning, even if it failed to generate any real-world value. If you were able to focus the attention of the entire planet on a single goal, even if just for one day, and even if it just involved dispatching aliens in a video game, it would be a truly awe-inspiring occasion. It would be the single biggest collective experience ever undertaken in the whole of human history. It would give the whole earth goose bumps.</div>
<div class="fmtx3"><i class="calibre6">That’s</i> the epic scale that gamers are capable of thinking on. That’s the scale gamers are ready to work at.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Gamers can imagine 6 billion people coming together to fight a fictional  enemy, for the sheer awe and wonder of it. They are ready to work together on extreme scales, toward epic goals, just for the spine-tingling joy of it. And the more we seek out that kind of happiness as a planet, the more likely we are to save it—not from fictional aliens, but from apathy and wasted potential.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Jean M. Twenge, a professor of psychology and the author of <i class="calibre6">Generation Me</i>, has persuasively argued that the youngest generations today—particularly anyone born after 1980—are, in her words, “more miserable than ever before.” Why? Because of our increased cultural emphasis on “self-esteem” and “self-fulfillment.” But real fulfillment, as countless psychologists, philosophers, and spiritual leaders have shown, comes from fulfilling commitments to others. We want to be esteemed in the eyes of others, not for “who we are,” but rather for what we’ve done that really matters.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The more we focus on ourselves and avoid a commitment to others, Twenge’s research shows, the more we suffer from anxiety and depression. But that doesn’t stop us from trying to make ourselves happy alone. We mistakenly think that by putting ourselves first, we’ll finally get what we want. In fact, true happiness comes not from thinking <i class="calibre6">more</i> of ourselves, but rather from thinking <i class="calibre6">less</i> of ourselves—from seeing the truly small role we play in something much bigger, much more important than our individual needs.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Joining any collective effort and embracing feelings of awe can help us unlock our potential to lead a meaningful life and to leave a meaningful mark on the world.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Even if it’s a virtual world we’re leaving our mark on, we’re still learning what it feels like to be of service to a larger cause. We’re priming our brains and bodies to value and to seek out epic meaning as an emotional reward. And as recent research suggests, the more we enjoy these rewards in game worlds, the more likely we may be to seek them out in real life.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Three scientific studies published in 2009 by a consortium of researchers from eight universities in the United States, Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia studied the relationship between time spent playing games that require “helpful behavior” and the gamers’ willingness to help others in everyday life. One study focused on children age thirteen and younger, another on teenagers, and the third on college students. The researchers worked with more than  three thousand young gamers in total, and in all three studies they reached the same conclusion: young people who spend more time playing games in which they’re required to help each other are significantly more likely to help friends, family, neighbors, and even strangers in their real lives.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en164" id="Ref-en164"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">33</sup><br class="calibre2"/>33</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Although these studies weren’t specifically looking at epic-scale games, the core findings seem likely to remain consistent, or even increase, at larger scales. As Brad Bushman, one coauthor of the studies and a professor of communications and psychology at the University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research, puts it, “These findings suggest there is an upward spiral of prosocial gaming and helpful behavior.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en165" id="Ref-en165"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">34</sup><br class="calibre2"/>34</a> In other words, the more we help in games, the more we help in life. And so there’s good reason to believe that the more we learn to enjoy serving epic causes in game worlds, the more we may find ourselves contributing to epic efforts in the real world.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">THE PSYCHOLOGIST</b> Abraham Maslow famously said, “It isn’t normal to know what we want. It is a rare and difficult psychological achievement.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en166" id="Ref-en166"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">35</sup><br class="calibre2"/>35</a> But today’s best games give us a powerful tool for achieving exactly that rare kind of self-knowledge.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Games are showing us exactly what we want out of life: more satisfying work, better hope of success, stronger social connectivity, and the chance to be a part of something bigger than ourselves. With games that help us generate these four rewards every day, we have unlimited potential to raise our own quality of life. And when we play these games with friends, family, and neighbors, we can enrich the lives of people we care about.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So games are teaching us to see what really makes us happy—and how to become the best versions of ourselves. But can we apply that knowledge to the real world?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">By supporting our four essential human cravings, and by providing a reliable source of flow and fiero, the gaming industry has gone a long way toward making us happier and more emotionally resilient—but only up to a point. We haven’t learned how to enjoy our <i class="calibre6">real lives</i> more thoroughly. Instead, we’ve spent the last thirty-five years learning to enjoy our <i class="calibre6">game lives</i> more thoroughly.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Instead of fixing reality, we’ve simply created more and more attractive alternatives to the boredom, anxiety, alienation, and meaninglessness we run up against so often in everyday life. It’s high time we start applying the lessons of games to the design of our everyday lives. We need to engineer <i class="calibre6">alternate</i> realities: new, more gameful ways of interacting with the real world and living our real lives.</div>
