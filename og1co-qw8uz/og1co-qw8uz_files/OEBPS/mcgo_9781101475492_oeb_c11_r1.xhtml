<div class="fmht"><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER ELEVEN</b></div>
<div class="fmht"><b class="calibre5">The Engagement Economy</b></div>
<div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">O</b>n June 24, 2009, more than twenty thousand Britons joined forces online to investigate one of the biggest scandals in British parliament history—investigations that led to the resignations of dozens of parliament members and ultimately inspired sweeping political reform. How did these ordinary citizens make such a big difference? They did it by playing a game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">When the game began, the scandal had been brewing in the newspapers for weeks. According to leaked government documents, hundreds of members of parliament, or MPs, were regularly filing illegal expense claims, charging taxpayers up to tens of thousands of pounds annually for personal expenses completely unrelated to their political service. In a particularly inflammatory exposé, the <i class="calibre6">Telegraph</i> reported that Sir Peter Viggers, an MP from the southern coast of England, claimed £32,000 for personal gardening expenses, including £1,645 for a “floating duck island.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en228" id="Ref-en228"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">1</sup><br class="calibre2"/>1</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">The public was outraged and demanded a full accounting of all MP expenses. In response, the government agreed to release the complete records for four years’ worth of MP claims. But in what was widely considered to be an attempt to hinder further investigation of the scandal, the government  shared the data in the most unhelpful format possible: an unsorted collection of more than a million expense forms and receipts that had been scanned electronically. The files were saved as images, so that it was impossible to search or to cross-reference the claims. And much of the data had been redacted with big black blocks obscuring the detailed descriptions of items expensed. The data dump was dubbed “Blackoutgate” and called a “cover-up of massive proportions.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en229" id="Ref-en229"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">2</sup><br class="calibre2"/>2</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">The editors at the <i class="calibre6">Guardian</i> knew it would take too long for their own reporters to sort through the entire data dump and make sense of it. So they decided to enlist the public’s direct help in uncovering whatever it was the authorities didn’t want uncovered. In other words, they “crowdsourced” the investigation.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The term <b class="calibre5">crowdsourcing</b>, coined by technology journalist Jeff Howe in 2006, is shorthand for outsourcing a job to the crowd.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en230" id="Ref-en230"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">3</sup><br class="calibre2"/>3</a> It means inviting a large group of people, usually on the Internet, to cooperatively tackle a big project. Wikipedia, the collaboratively authored online encyclopedia created by a crowd of more than 10 million unpaid (and often anonymous) writers and editors, is a prime example. Crowdsourcing is a way to do collectively, faster, better, and more cheaply what might otherwise be impossible for a single organization to do alone.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">With a million uncataloged government documents on its hands and no way of knowing which document could prove to be the smoking gun for which MP, the <i class="calibre6">Guardian</i> knew it needed all the crowd help it could get. So it decided to tap into the wisdom of the crowds—not with a wiki, however, but with a game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To develop the game, they turned to a young, but accomplished, London-based software developer named Simon Willison. His task: convert and condense all the scanned forms and expenses into 458,832 online documents, and set up a website where anyone could examine the public records for incriminating details. For the price of just a week’s worth of the development team’s time and a paltry fifty pounds to rent temporary servers to host the documents, the <i class="calibre6">Guardian</i> launched Investigate Your MP’s Expenses, the world’s first massively multiplayer investigative journalism project.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">HOW TO PLAY INVESTIGATE YOUR MP’S EXPENSES</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">Join us in digging through the MPs’ expenses to review each document. Your mission: Decide whether it contains interesting information, and extract the key facts.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Some pages will be covering letters or claim forms for office stationery. These can be safely ignored.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">But somewhere in here is the receipt for a duck island. And who knows what else may turn up. If you find something which you think needs further attention, simply hit the button marked “Investigate this!” and we’ll take a closer look.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx1">Step 1: Find a document.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Step 2: Decide what kind of thing it is (expenses claim, proof/ receipt, or blank)</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Step 3: Transcribe the line items</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Step 4: Make any specific observations about why a claim deserves further scrutiny</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx2">Examples of things to look out for: food bills, repeated claims for less than £250 (the limit for claims not backed up by a receipt), and rejected claims.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Investigate your own MP: Enter your postal code to bring up all of your MP’s claims and receipts. Or investigate by political party.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">All the MPs’ records are on there now—so let us know what you find.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Just three days into the game, it was clear that the crowdsourcing effort was an unprecedented success. More than 20,000 players had already analyzed more than 170,000 electronic documents. Michael Andersen, a member of  the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University and an expert on Internet journalism, reported at the time: “Journalism has been crowdsourced before, but it’s the scale of the <i class="calibre6">Guardian</i>’s project—170,000 documents reviewed in the first 80 hours, thanks to a visitor participation rate of 56 percent—that’s breathtaking.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en231" id="Ref-en231"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">4</sup><br class="calibre2"/>4</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">A visitor participation rate measures the percentage of visitors who sign up and make a contribution to a network. A rate of 56 percent for <i class="calibre6">any</i> crowdsourced project was unheard of previously. (By comparison, roughly 4.6 percent of visitors to Wikipedia make a contribution to the online encyclopedia.)<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en232" id="Ref-en232"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">5</sup><br class="calibre2"/>5</a> It’s <i class="calibre6">especially</i> breathtaking considering the mind-numbingly tedious nature of the actual accounting work being performed.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So what accounted for this unprecedented participation in a citizen journalism project? According to Willison, it all boiled down to rewarding participants in the right way: with the emotional rewards of a good game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">“The number one lesson from this project: Make it feel like a game,” Willison said in an interview with the Nieman Journalism Lab. “Any time that you’re trying to get people to give you stuff, to do stuff for you, the most important thing is that people know that what they’re doing is having an effect. If you’re not giving people the ‘I rock’ vibe, you’re not getting people to stick around.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The “I rock” vibe is another way of talking about classic game rewards, such as having a clear sense of purpose, making an obvious impact, making continuous progress, enjoying a good chance of success, and experiencing plenty of fiero moments. The Investigate Your MP’s Expenses project featured all of these emotional rewards, in droves.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The game interface made it easy to take action and see your impact right away. When you examined a document, you had a panel of bright, shiny buttons to press depending on what you’d found. First, you’d decide what kind of document you were looking at: a claim form, proof (a receipt, invoice, or purchase order), a blank page, or “something we haven’t thought of.” Then you’d determine the level of interest of the document: “Interesting,” “Not interesting,” or “Investigate this! I want to know more.” When you’d made your selection, the button lit up, giving you a satisfying feeling of productivity,  even if all you’d found was a blank page that wasn’t very interesting. And there was always a real hope of success: the promise of finding the next “duck pond” to keep you working quickly through the flow of documents.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">A real-time activity feed showed the names of players logged in recently and the actions they’d taken in the game. This feed made the site feel social. Even though you were not directly interacting with other players, you were copresent with them on the site and sharing the same experience. There was also a series of top contributor lists, for the previous forty-eight hours as well as for all time, to motivate both short-term and long-term participation. And to celebrate successful participation, as well as sheer volume of participation, there was also a “best individual discoveries” page that identified key findings from individual players. Some of these discoveries were over-the-top luxuries offensive to one’s sense of propriety: a £240 giraffe print or a £225 fountain pen, for example. Others were mathematical errors or inconsistencies suggesting individuals were reimbursed more than they were owed. As one player noted, “Bad math on page 29 of an invoice from MP Denis MacShane, who claimed £1,730 worth of reimbursement, when the sum of those items listed was only £1,480.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But perhaps most importantly, the website also featured a section labeled “Data: What we’ve learned from your work so far.” This page put the individual players’ efforts into a much bigger context—and guaranteed that contributors would see the real results of their efforts. Some of the key results of the game included these findings:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• On average, each MP expensed <i class="calibre6">twice</i> his or her annual salary, or more than £140,000 in expenses on top of a £60,675 salary.</div><div class="lsl">• The total cost to taxpayers of personal items expensed by MPs is £88 million annually.</div></div></div>
<div class="fmtx3">And the game detailed:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• The number of receipts and papers filed by each MP, ranging between 40 and 2,000 </div><div class="lsl">• The total expense spending by party and by category (kitchen, garden, TV, food, etc.)</div><div class="lsl">• Online maps comparing travel expenses filed with actual distance from the House of Commons in London to the MPs’ home districts, making it easy to spot MPs grossly overcharging for travel (for example, MPs from nearby districts who filed £21,534 versus £4,418, or £10,105 versus £1,680)</div></div></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Bringing these numbers to light helped clarify the true extent of the crisis: a far more pervasive culture of extravagant personal reimbursement than originally suspected.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So what did the players accomplish? Real political results. At least twenty-eight MPs resigned or declared their intention to do so at the end of their term, and by early 2010 criminal proceedings against four MPs investigated by the players were under way. New expense codes are being written, and old codes are being enforced more vigorously. Most concretely, hundreds of MPs were ordered to repay a total of £1.12 million.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en233" id="Ref-en233"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">6</sup><br class="calibre2"/>6</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s not all the doing of the <i class="calibre6">Guardian</i>’s gamers, of course. But without a doubt, the game played a crucial role. The citizen journalists helped put significant political pressure on the British government by keeping the scandal in the news. The longer the game continued, the more public momentum built to force major policy reform.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Investigate Your MP’s Expenses enabled tens of thousands of citizens to participate directly in a new kind of political reform movement. Instead of just clamoring for change, they put their time and effort into creating evidence that change was needed. Crucially, the crowd of gamers did all of this important work faster than any individual organization could have, and they did it for free—lowering the costs of investigative journalism and speeding up the democratic reform process.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Not all crowdsourcing projects are so successful. Working together on extreme scales is easier said than done. You can’t crowdsource without a crowd—and it turns out that actively engaged crowds can be hard to come by.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In 2008, New York University professor and Internet researcher Clay Shirky  sat down with IBM researcher Martin Wattenberg and tried to work out exactly how much human effort has gone into making Wikipedia. They looked at the total number of articles and edits, as well as the average article length and average time per edit. They factored in all of the reading time required to find knowledge gaps and spot errors, and all of the hours of programming and ongoing community management required to make those edits hang together coherently. After a lot of clever math, they worked out the following estimate:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">If you take Wikipedia as a kind of unit, all of Wikipedia, the whole project—every page, every edit, every talk page, every line of code, in every language that Wikipedia exists in—that represents something like the accumulation of 100 million hours of human thought.... It’s a back-of-the-envelope calculation, but it’s the right order of magnitude, about 100 million hours of thought.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en234" id="Ref-en234"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">7</sup><br class="calibre2"/>7</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">On one hand, that’s no trivial effort. It’s the equivalent of rounding up a million people and convincing them to spend a hundred hours each contributing to Wikipedia, for free. Put another way: it’s like persuading ten thousand people to dedicate five full-time work years to the Wikipedia project. That’s a <i class="calibre6">lot</i> of effort to ask a <i class="calibre6">lot</i> of people to make, for no extrinsic reward, on behalf of someone else’s vision.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">On the other hand, given that there are 1.7 billion Internet users on the planet and twenty-four hours in a day, it really shouldn’t be that hard to successfully pull off lots of projects on the scale of Wikipedia.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en235" id="Ref-en235"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">8</sup><br class="calibre2"/>8</a> Hypothetically, if we could provide the right motivation, we should be able to complete one hundred Wikipedia-size projects <i class="calibre6">every single day—</i>if we could convince all 1.7 billion Internet users to spend most of their free time voluntarily contributing to crowdsourced projects.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Maybe that’s unrealistic. More reasonably, if we could convince every Internet user to volunteer just one single hour a week, we could accomplish a great deal. Collectively, we would be able to complete nearly <i class="calibre6">twenty</i> Wikipedia-size projects <i class="calibre6">every single week</i>.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Which really makes you wonder: with so much potential, why aren’t there even more Wikipedia-scale projects out there?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The truth is, the Internet is littered with underperforming, barely populated, or completely abandoned collaboration spaces: wikis that have no contributors, discussion forums with no comments, open-source projects with no active users, social networks with barely a few members, and Facebook groups with plenty of members but few who ever do anything after joining. According to Shirky, more than half of all collaborative projects online fail to achieve the minimum number of participants necessary to even begin working on their goal, let alone achieve it.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s not for a lack of time spent on the Internet. It’s just incredibly difficult to achieve the necessary critical mass of participation on any given serious project.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">For one thing, some participatory networks are more rewarding than others—and the most readily rewarding networks aren’t, as a rule, the ones doing serious work. Online games and “fun” social networks like Facebook provide the steadiest stream of intrinsic rewards. They’re <i class="calibre6">autotelic</i> spaces—spaces we visit for the pure enjoyment of it. Their primary purpose is to be rewarding, not to solve a problem or get work done. Unlike serious projects, they are engineered first and foremost to engage and satisfy our emotional cravings. And as a result, <i class="calibre6">they</i> are the projects that are absorbing the vast majority of our online <b class="calibre5">participation bandwidth</b>—our individual and collective capacity to contribute to one or more participatory networks.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">A second and more pressing problem is the fact that, across serious crowd projects, our participation resources are increasingly being spread too thin.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In the past month, I’ve been invited to join exactly forty-three Facebook groups. I’ve been asked to help edit fifteen wikis and contribute to nearly twenty Google Docs. And I’ve been (unsuccessfully) recruited for nearly twenty other assorted collective intelligence projects, each one requesting me to spend valuable online time voting, ranking, judging, editing, sorting, labeling, approving, commenting, translating, predicting, contributing, or otherwise participating in someone else’s idea of a worthy mission. I may be an extreme example—I’m a highly networked individual with many personal contacts doing interesting work online. But I’m certainly not alone in feeling overwhelmed by participation  requests. Increasingly, I hear the same complaint from friends, colleagues, and clients: there are simply too many demands, from too many people, on our online engagement.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">I call it “participation spam.” It’s the increasingly unsolicited requests we receive on a daily basis to participate in someone else’s group. If you’re not getting participation-spammed yet, you will—and soon.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">By my own back-of-the-envelope estimate, there are currently more than 200 million public requests for crowd participation on the Internet, across thousands of different networks, ranging from citizen journalism, citizen science, and open government to peer-to-peer advice, social networking, and open innovation. This estimate factors in, for example, more than 1 million public social networks created on Ning, more than 100,000 wikis on Wikia, more than 100,000 crowdsourcing projects on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk, at least 20,000 videos awaiting transcription and translation on DotSUB, as well as myriad smaller clusters of open collaboration, such as the more than 3,300 public “idea spaces” for proposing and developing innovative ideas on IBM Lotus’ IdeaJam and more than 14,000 on Dell’s IdeaStorm.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">With 1.7 billion people on the Internet, that works out to about 8.5 people per crowd.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">That’s a very small crowd.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s certainly not a big enough crowd to build a resource on the scale of Wikipedia.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">This problem is likely going to get worse before it gets better. As it becomes easier and cheaper to launch a participation network, it will likely become equally difficult to sustain it. There are only so many potential participants on the Internet. And as long as participation is designed as an active process requiring some mental effort, there are only so many units of engagement, or mental hours, each participant can reasonably expend in a given hour, day, week, or month.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To effectively harness the wisdom of the crowds, and to successfully leverage the participation of the many, organizations will need to become effective players in an emerging <b class="calibre5">engagement economy</b>. In the economy of engagement, it is less and less important to compete for attention and more and more  important to compete for things like brain cycles and interactive bandwidth. Crowd-dependent projects must figure out how to capture the mental energy and the active effort it takes to make individual contributions to a larger whole. For this reason, the overall crowdsourcing culture likely will not be immune from “the tragedy of the commons”—the crisis that occurs when individuals selfishly exhaust a collective resource. Collaboration projects will have to compete for crowd resources as online communities seek to grab as many mental hours as possible from their members. These gains will likely come at the expense of other projects still striving to secure their own passionate community. Collaboration may be the signature modus operandi of these projects, but the competition for participants will be fierce and not all projects will thrive.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As we consider these challenges, some of the key questions for the emerging engagement economy start to arise: Who will do all of the participating necessary to make the seemingly endless flow of participatory projects a success? Are there enough willing quality collaborators in the world to do it? How do you draw a big and passionate enough crowd to tackle extreme-scale goals? And what will motivate the crowds who do show up to stick around long enough to collectively create something of value?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We have to face facts. It’s very difficult to motivate large numbers of people to come together at the same time and to contribute any significant amount of energy—let alone their very best effort—to a collaborative project. Most big crowd projects today fail: they fail to attract a crowd, or they fail to give the crowd the right kind of work, or they fail to reward the crowd well enough to keep it participating over the long haul.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But it’s not hopeless. As both Wikipedia and Investigate Your MP’s Expenses show, there are significant crowdsourcing projects succeeding. And they all have one important thing in common: they’re structured like a good multiplayer game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The most active contributors to Wikipedia, the world’s most successful crowdsourced project, already know this. In fact, they’ve created a special project to detail all the ways in which Wikipedia is like a game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As more than fifty leading Wikipedia contributors have helped explain,  “One theory that explains the addictive quality of Wikipedia and its tendency to produce Wikipediholics (people who are addicted to editing Wikipedia articles) is that Wikipedia is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game.” And, according to the happily addicted Wikipedians, it works like a good MMORPG in three key ways.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">First, Wikipedia is a <b class="calibre5">good game world</b>. Its extreme scale inspires our sense of awe and wonder, while its sprawling navigation encourages curiosity, exploration, and collaboration. Here’s exactly how the Wikipedians described it in one recent version of the constantly changing wiki page:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">Wikipedia has an immersive game world with over 10.7 million <i class="calibre6">players</i> (registered contributors, or “Wikipedians”) and over 3.06 million <i class="calibre6">unique locations</i> (Wikipedia articles), including 137,356 undiscovered <i class="calibre6">secret areas</i> (“lonely pages,” or articles that aren’t linked to any other articles and therefore can’t be found by browsing), 7,500 completely explored <i class="calibre6">dungeons</i> (“good articles,” or exhaustively written articles with excellent citations and evidence provided), and 2,700 <i class="calibre6">boss levels</i> (“featured articles,” or the top-ranking articles as judged by accuracy, neutrality, completeness, and style).<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en236" id="Ref-en236"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">9</sup><br class="calibre2"/>9</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In other words, Wikipedia, like all of the most engaging multiplayer game worlds, is an <i class="calibre6">epic built environment</i>. It invites participants to explore, act, and spend large amounts of time there.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Second, Wikipedia has <b class="calibre5">good game mechanics</b>. Player action has direct and clear results: edits appear instantly on the site, giving users a powerful sense of control over the environment. This instant impact creates optimism and a strong sense of self-efficacy. It features unlimited work opportunities, of escalating difficulty. As the Wikipedians describe it, “Players can take on <i class="calibre6">quests</i> (WikiProjects, efforts to organize many articles into a single, larger article), fight <i class="calibre6">boss-level battles</i> (featured articles that are held to higher standards than ordinary articles), and enter <i class="calibre6">battle arenas</i> (interventions against article vandalism).” It also has a personal feedback system that helps Wikipedians feel like  they are improving and making personal progress as they contribute. “Players can accumulate <i class="calibre6">experience points</i> (edit count), allowing them to advance to higher <i class="calibre6">levels</i> (lists of top-ranking Wikipedians by number of edits).”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Meanwhile, like all good games, there is significant friction to achieving the goal. It’s not just about making good edits. The game also has a clearly defined enemy to defeat: vandals who make unhelpful edits to the site. “Edit wars” are said to break out between competing contributors with different points of view, and players have developed collaboration techniques and combat tools to deal with these high-level challenges. As an edit war escalates, more and more editors are called to join the conversation and work toward a solution.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Which leads to the third key aspect of Wikipedia’s good gameness: it has <b class="calibre5">good game community</b>. Good game community requires two things: plenty of positive social interaction and a meaningful context for collective effort. Wikipedia has both. As Wikipedians describe it:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">Every <i class="calibre6">unique location</i> (article) in the <i class="calibre6">game world</i> (encyclopedia) has a <i class="calibre6">tavern</i> (“talk page,” or discussion forum) where players have the opportunity to interact with any other player in real time. Players often become friends with other players, and some have even arranged to <i class="calibre6">meet in real life</i> (“meetups,” or face-to-face social gatherings for frequent Wikipedia contributors).</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The talk pages encourage both sociable competition (arguing over recent edits) and collaboration (improving and organizing existing articles). This kind of persistent positive social interaction around common goals builds trust and strong bonds—which naturally extends to face-to-face relationships. Indeed, roughly a hundred Wikipedia meetups occur a year, everywhere from Reykjavik, Cape Town, Munich, and Buenos Aires to Perth, Kyoto, Jakarta, and Nashville.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Also crucial to good community is the sense of meaning created by belonging and contributing to such an epic project. Wikipedia members are always  working toward extreme-scale goals—aiming first for 100,000 articles, then 1 million, then 2 million, and then 3 million—as well as celebrating traffic milestones—the date Wikipedia first broke into the top 500 websites, the top 100, the top 20, and, most recently, the top 10. And they are constantly immersed in awe-inspiring project statistics, greeted on the site’s home page with a list of the more than 270 different language versions of Wikipedia and growing.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Wikipedians explicitly credit the good gameness of the system—its compelling game world, satisfying game mechanics, and inspiring game community—for their dedicated long-term participation. To conclude their analysis of Wikipedia as an MMORPG: “People tend to play a given MMORPG for six to eighteen months at a high level of involvement; a similar pattern (of “Wikibreaking,” or separating from the site to attend to other projects) has been noted in hard-core Wikipedia players.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en237" id="Ref-en237"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">10</sup><br class="calibre2"/>10</a> In other words, most games eventually get boring—we exhaust their challenges and creative possibilities—and Wikipedia is no different. While there are some perpetual Wikipedians, most members are of service to the site for a limited period of time, after which they’re likely to move on to a new system that offers new content and fresher challenges.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The “Wikipedia is an MMORPG” project is particularly compelling precisely because so much valuable participation effort is being spent in MMORPG environments.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Take <i class="calibre6">World of Warcraft</i>, for example—the most successful MMORPG ever. Currently, with more than 11.5 million subscribers, each averaging between sixteen and twenty-two hours a week playing the game, that’s 210 million participation hours spent weekly on just a single MMORPG. And the number of <i class="calibre6">WoW</i> subscribers is almost exactly the same as the number of registered contributors to Wikipedia.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Based on Clay Shirky’s estimate that all of Wikipedia took 100 million hours to create, the <i class="calibre6">WoW</i> community alone could conceivably create a new Wikipedia every three and a half days.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But let’s say, for argument’s sake, that most people who play <i class="calibre6">WoW</i> wouldn’t  be even remotely interested in any kind of collective intelligence project. There are still more than 65,000 <i class="calibre6">WoW</i> players who are registered contributors to WoWWiki, currently the world’s second largest wiki after Wikipedia. Even if you managed to successfully engage only that group, it would still take them only <i class="calibre6">two months</i> of channeling their usual <i class="calibre6">WoW</i> playing time to a crowdsourcing project to collectively create a resource on the scale of Wikipedia. By comparison, Wikipedia took <i class="calibre6">eight years</i> to collect 100 million hours of cognitive effort.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">When I first started looking at these numbers, I had two insights.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">First, gamers are an extremely valuable—and largely untapped—source of participation bandwidth. Whoever figures out how to effectively engage them first for real work is going to reap enormous benefits. (And clearly, the Guardian’s Investigate Your MP’s Expenses represents one of the first organizations to do just that.)</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Second, crowdsourcing projects—if they have any hope of capturing enough participation bandwidth to achieve truly ambitious goals—must be intentionally designed to offer the same kinds of intrinsic rewards we get from good games. Increasingly, I’m convinced that this is the only way to dramatically increase our total available participation bandwidth. If everyone spent as much time actively engaged in good, hard work as gamers do, we wouldn’t be competing for scarce crowd resources. We’d have massively more mental hours to pour into important collective efforts.</div>

<h1 class="h"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Making Better Use of Gamers’ Participation Bandwidth</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
充分利用玩家的参与带宽</h1>
<div class="fmtx">My experience and research suggests that gamers are more likely than anyone on the planet to contribute to an online crowdsourcing project. They already have the time and the desire to tackle voluntary obstacles. They’re playing games precisely because they hunger for more and better engagement. They also have proven computer skills and an ability to learn new interactive  interfaces quickly. And if they’re playing games online, they already have the necessary network access to join any online project and start participating immediately.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Given the highly social nature of today’s best games, gamers are also very likely to have a large network of friends and family they already bring from one game to the next. This is exactly the kind of social infrastructure necessary to help grow any participation base.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">On the whole, gamers already spend more time compiling collective intelligence—and making effective use of it—than anyone else. They’re the most prolific users of wikis in the world. On Wikia, for example, the most popular wiki-hosting service, gamers are by far the leading creators of content and the most active users. With more than a million articles on ten thousand distinct wikis—each wiki for a different game—they represent the lion’s share of active content across the entire Wikia network. And as Artur Bergman, vice president of engineering and operations at Wikia, has told me many times, they are by far the most organized and ambitious wiki users on the network. “The gamers are amazing,” he said this fall, after watching multiple game walk-throughs go up overnight for newly released games. “The minute the game comes out, they start making round-the-clock edits. Within twenty-four hours, they have the whole thing documented.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The minute gamers get their hands on a new game, they start compiling collective intelligence about it. It’s not something that happens after they get tired of playing—it’s an essential part of gaming. And, according to Wikia’s traffic statistics, for every single wiki contributor, thousands more players show up to make use of the data. Gamers make daily use of collective intelligence, and as a result they instinctively understand the value and possibility of big crowd projects.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In short, gamers are already our most readily engageable citizens.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We also have ample proof that gamers want to do more than just save the virtual world. Two key projects show just how much online gamers want to do real-world good: the world hunger-fighting game Free Rice and the cancer-fighting gamer initiative Folding@home on the PlayStation 3.</div>
<h2 class="h1"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">FREE RICE—OR HOW TO PLAY AND FEED HUNGRY PEOPLE</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
免费大米——或者如何玩耍和喂饱饥饿的人们</h2>
<div class="fmtx">“Feeling guilty about wasting time on computer solitaire? Join the growing guilt-free multitude at <a href="http://FreeRice.com">FreeRice.com<br class="calibre2"/>免费大米网站</a>, an online game with redeeming social value.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en238" id="Ref-en238"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">11</sup><br class="calibre2"/>11</a> That’s how <i class="calibre6">USA Today</i> described Free Rice, a nonprofit game designed to help gamers battle world hunger while they play.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The gameplay is simple: answer a multiple-choice vocabulary question correctly, and you earn ten virtual grains of rice. The better you do, the harder the questions get; it took me only six questions in my latest game before getting stumped by this one:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1"><i class="calibre6"><b class="calibre5">Acrogenous</b></i> <b class="calibre5">means:</b> <div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• created top down</div><div class="lsl">• extremely generous</div><div class="lsl">• growing from the tip of a stem</div><div class="lsl">• pointy-headed</div></div></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">(<i class="calibre6">Hint:</i> It turns out “acrogenous” is a botanical term—see the endnotes for the answer.) <a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en239" id="Ref-en239"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">12</sup><br class="calibre2"/>12</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">You can stack up as much virtual rice as you want, and at the end of your game, it gets converted to real rice, which is donated to the United Nations World Food Programme. (The rice is provided by sponsors whose online advertisements appear underneath every question in the game.)</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To earn enough rice to feed one person one meal, I’d have to answer two hundred questions correctly. But it’s not the kind of game you really want to play for hours on end. In fact, usually I just play for about a minute or two, or roughly ten questions at a time, whenever I want a quick burst of satisfying productivity and feel-good activity. But earning a hundred grains a day is barely a teaspoon’s worth; luckily I’m not the only person playing. On any given day, between two hundred thousand and five hundred thousand people play Free Rice; together, according to the game’s FAQ, their efforts add up to enough rice to feed an average of seven thousand people per day.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Why is Free Rice able to capture so much engagement? It isn’t just that it  is a force for good; it’s also classically good game design. It takes just seconds to complete a task, meaning you can get a lot of work done quickly. You get instant visual feedback: grains of rice stacking up in a bowl, with a constantly rising total of grains that you’ve earned. Because the game gets easier when you make mistakes and harder when you answer correctly, it’s easy to experience flow: you’re always playing at the limits of your ability. And since the game was created, in 2007, its game world has expanded significantly: there’s a seemingly endless stream of potential tasks, with thirteen different subject areas, from famous paintings and world capitals to chemical symbols and French vocabulary. There’s also a clear sense that you’re a part of something bigger as you play. As the Free Rice site explains, “Though 10 grains of rice may seem like a small amount, it is important to remember that while you are playing, so are thousands of other people at the same time. It is everyone together that makes the difference.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en240" id="Ref-en240"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">13</sup><br class="calibre2"/>13</a> So far, that difference is nothing less than epic: 69,024,128,710 grains of rice and counting—enough to provide more than 10 million meals worldwide.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Free Rice in one respect seems like a perfect embodiment of the crowdsourcing philosophy: lots of people come together to make a small contribution, all of it adding up to something bigger. But Free Rice actually falls short of real crowdsourcing. That’s because the grains of rice aren’t coming from the players—they’re coming from a small number of advertisers who agree to pay the cost of ten grains of bulk rice for every correct-answer page view. Those advertisers are paying for the gamers’ eyeballs on the page. So the actual game-play activity isn’t generating any new knowledge or value; the advertisers are just happy to have their advertisement on a page they know hundreds of thousands of people will see daily.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">That means Free Rice is less like Wikipedia and more like clever fundraising. But Free Rice is still an extremely important project, for one big reason: it irrefutably shows that gamers are, on the whole, happier when a good game also does real-world good. There’s no evidence that hundreds of thousands of people would show up to play a bad game just to help out a good cause. But the combination of good game design and real-world results is irresistible.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It also points the way to bigger possibilities. What if people playing Free  Rice were actually contributing something other than their attention to advertising? What could gamers easily contribute, and what would it add up to? We can catch an even better glimpse of gamers’ potential to engage in epic problem solving in a different crowd project: Folding@home, a project designed to harness gamers’ hardware for good.</div>
<h2 class="h1"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">FOLDING@HOME ON PLAYSTATION 3</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
PLAYSTATION 3上的 FOLDING@HOME</h2>
<div class="fmtx">“If you own a PS3, start saving lives. <i class="calibre6">Real</i> lives.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en241" id="Ref-en241"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">14</sup><br class="calibre2"/>14</a> That’s how one blogger put it when he discovered Folding@home for the PlayStation 3, the world’s first distributed computing initiative just for gamers. A distributed computing system is like crowdsourcing for computers. It connects individual computers via the Internet into a giant virtual supercomputer in order to tackle complex computational tasks that no individual computer could solve alone.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">For years, scientists have been harnessing the processing power of home computers to create virtual supercomputers tasked with solving real scientific problems. The most famous example is SETI@home, or Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence at home, a program that harnesses home computers to analyze radio signals from space for signs of intelligent life in the universe. Folding@home is a similar system created by biologists and medical researchers at Stanford University in an effort to solve one of the greatest mysteries of human biology: how proteins fold.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Why is protein folding important? Proteins are the building blocks of all biological activity. Everything that happens in our bodies is a result of proteins at work: they support our skeleton, move our muscles, control our five senses, digest our food, defend against infections, and help our brain process emotions. There are more than one hundred thousand kinds of proteins in the human body, each consisting of anywhere from one hundred to one thousand different parts and made up of any combination of twenty different amino acids. In order to do its specific job, each kind of protein folds up into a unique shape.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en242" id="Ref-en242"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">15</sup><br class="calibre2"/>15岁</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Biologists describe this process as a kind of incredibly complex origami.  The parts can be arranged and folded up in almost any imaginable combination and form. Even if you know which amino acids make up a protein, and in how many parts, it’s still nearly impossible to predict exactly what form the protein will take. One thing scientists know for sure, however, is that sometimes, for unknown reasons, proteins stop folding correctly. They “forget” what shape to take—and when they do, this can lead to disease. Alzheimer’s disease, cystic fibrosis, Mad Cow disease, and even many cancers, for example, are believed to result from protein misfolding.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So scientists want to understand exactly how proteins fold and what shapes they take, in order to figure out how to stop proteins from misfolding. But given the nearly infinitely many different shapes each protein can take, it requires an incredibly long time to test all the various potential shapes. Computer programs can simulate every possible shape that a protein with a certain amino acid composition could make. But it would take <i class="calibre6">thirty years</i> to test all the different combinations for just one single protein, out of the hundred thousand proteins in our bodies. As the Folding@home FAQ section puts it, “That’s a long time to wait for one result!”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">That’s why scientists use distributed computing systems. By dividing the work between multiple processors, the work can go much, much faster. Since 2001, anyone in the world has been able to connect their personal computer to the Folding@home network. Whenever their computer is idle, it connects to the network and downloads a small processing assignment—just a few minutes’ worth of protein-folding simulation. It submits the data to the network when it’s done.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But after nearly a decade of tapping into the spare processing power of personal computers, the team behind Folding@home realized that a more powerful platform for virtual supercomputing exists: game consoles like the PlayStation 3.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">When it comes to data-crunching ability, game consoles are significantly more powerful than the average PC. That’s because the computational power required to render constantly changing 3D graphic environments is much greater than what’s required for ordinary home or work computing tasks, like  Internet browsing or word processing. Even though there are collectively many more PCs in our homes than game consoles, if scientists could get even a small fraction of gamers to participate in distributed computing projects, they could double, triple, or even quadruple their supercomputing power.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But would gamers do it? Sony, the makers of the PS3 console, bet that they would. And they were right.</div>
<div class="centeraligned"><img alt="010" class="imgepub1" src="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_010_r1.gif"/></div>
<div class="ctag">Screenshot of the Folding@home application for the PlayStation 3 system.</div>
<div class="ctag"><i class="calibre6">(Sony Corporation, 2009)</i></div>
<div class="fmtx3">As a philanthropic venture, Sony developed a custom Folding@home application for the PS3. Gamers could log in, accept a protein-folding mission, and donate the power of their PS3 to get the mission done. They could watch the folding simulation in action, and keep tabs on just how much computational effort they’d personally contributed to the project.</div>
<div class="fmtx3"><i class="calibre6">Help save real lives when you’re not saving virtual lives.</i> The message was compelling, and it caught on fast. Within days of Sony releasing the application,  thousands of blog posts and online articles about “gaming for the greater good” spread across the entire online gamer landscape.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The gamer community has rallied around the mission with enormous enthusiasm. Online articles and blog posts proudly proclaimed: “PS3 Gamers Trying to Save the World!” On forums, players encouraged each other: “Have you cured cancer lately? Now is the best time to jump in and join the cancer-saving fun.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en243" id="Ref-en243"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">16</sup><br class="calibre2"/>16岁</a> They set up competitive folding teams and tried to rally each other to action: “Your PS3 can’t do it without you.” “It’s time to do your part for humanity.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en244" id="Ref-en244"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">17</sup><br class="calibre2"/>17</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Within six months, gamers collectively helped the Folding@home network achieve supercomputing milestones never achieved by any other distributed computing network anywhere in the world. As a senior developer for the PS3 Folding@home project announced on the official PlayStation blog:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">This time it’s something that the Folding community and the computer science field as a whole have been anxiously awaiting—the crossing of a milestone known as a petaflop. A petaflop equals one quadrillion floating point operations per second (FLOPS). If you’d like to imagine this enormous computation capacity, think about calculating a tip on a restaurant bill, now do that for 75,000 different bills, now do that every second, and lastly, imagine everybody on the planet is doing those calculations at the same second—this is a petaflop calculation. Now you see why I say enormous . . .<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en245" id="Ref-en245"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">18</sup><br class="calibre2"/>18岁</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">With an epic context like that, it’s no wonder gamers rose to the occasion. They live for opportunities to be of service to extreme-scale goals. As one gamer said, “You might as well be bragging that you helped cure cancer, instead of just beating the game on the hardest difficulty level without dying once.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en246" id="Ref-en246"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">19</sup><br class="calibre2"/>19</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Today, PS3 users account for 74 percent of the processing power used by Folding@home. So far, more than a million PS3 gamers on six continents have contributed spare computing cycles to the Folding@home project. That’s one  out of every twenty-five gamers on the PS3 network.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en247" id="Ref-en247"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">20</sup><br class="calibre2"/>20</a> The gamers are vastly outcontributing everyone else on the network—and they’re far more active on Folding@home forums, keeping close tabs on what their efforts are adding up to.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Now every PS3 comes preloaded with Folding@home software, making it even easier for any gamer to opt in to a scientific mission. As it stands, long after the initial September 2008 launch, gamers continue to sign up for the collective effort at the rate of three thousand a day, or two new volunteers every minute.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en248" id="Ref-en248"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">21</sup><br class="calibre2"/>二十一岁</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">The Folding@home project for the PlayStation 3 is a perfect example of matching ability with opportunity, which is the fundamental dynamic of any good crowdsourcing project. It’s not enough to draw a crowd—you have to ask the crowd to do something they have a real chance of doing successfully. Every PS3 gamer is capable of easily and successfully contributing spare processing power. Meanwhile, Sony, working with Stanford University, has created an opportunity for that contribution to really mean something.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">GAMERS’ MASS PARTICIPATION</b> in, and enthusiasm for, this big crowd project is a clear sign that there is a growing desire to be of service to real-world causes. For decades, gamers have been answering heroic calls to action in virtual worlds. It’s time we ask them to answer real-world calls to action, and all the evidence suggests that they are more than happy—they are <i class="calibre6">happier</i>—to rise to the real-world occasion.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The next major step to take, then, will be to harness gamers’ minds, and not just their consoles. Gamers are creative, persistent, and always up for a good challenge. Their strong cognitive resources, combined with their proven engageability, are a valuable resource just waiting to be tapped. In fact, a team of medical scientists, computer scientists, engineers, and professional game developers from the Seattle area are banking on that fact. They believe that gamers can use their natural creative ability and problem-solving abilities to learn to design new protein shapes and actively help cure diseases. They’ve created a protein-folding game called Foldit, which represents a dramatic leap of faith forward from the Folding@home project.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Instead of harnessing their video game <i class="calibre6">hardware</i> to run complex protein-folding simulations, Foldit harnesses the real brain power of gamers, challenging them to use their creativity and ingenuity to fold digital proteins by hand.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In the game, players manipulate proteins in a 3D virtual environment that one reviewer describes as “a twenty-first-century version of Tetris, with multicolored geometric snakes filling the screen.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en249" id="Ref-en249"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">22</sup><br class="calibre2"/>22</a> The geometric snakes represent all the different building blocks of a protein, the amino acid chains that connect and fold up into incredibly complex patterns in order to perform different biological tasks in the body. In Foldit, the player’s goal is to learn what kinds of patterns are the most stable and successful for doing different jobs, by taking an unfolded protein and folding it up into the right shape. This is called a “protein puzzle.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Players learn how to fold proteins by working on “solved” puzzles, or proteins that scientists already know how to fold. Once they’ve got the hang of it, they’re encouraged to try to predict the shape of a protein that scientists haven’t successfully folded yet, or to design a new protein shape from scratch, which researchers could then manufacture in a lab.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">“Our ultimate goal is to have ordinary people play the game and eventually be candidates for winning the Nobel Prize in biology, chemistry or medicine.” Zoran Popović, a professor of computer science and engineering at the University of Washington, and one of the lead researchers on the Foldit project, declared these Nobel aspirations in his address to the Games for Health conference in the spring of 2008, just weeks before opening up the new protein-folding puzzle game to the public.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en250" id="Ref-en250"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">23</sup><br class="calibre2"/>23</a> Within eighteen months of its release, the game had attracted a registered community of more than 112,700 players—most of whom, according to researchers, had little to no previous experience in the field of protein folding. “We’re hopefully going to change the way science is done, and who it’s done by,” Popović said.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The Foldit team is well on its way to doing just that. In the August 2010 issue of the prestigious scientific journal <i class="calibre6">Nature</i>, the team declared its first significant breakthrough: In a series of ten challenges, gamers beat the world’s most sophisticated protein-folding algorithms five times, and drew even three  times. The authors concluded that gamer intuition can successfully compete with supercomputers—especially when the problems being solved require taking radical, creative risks.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en251" id="Ref-en251"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">24</sup><br class="calibre2"/>24</a> Most notably, the <i class="calibre6">Nature</i> study wasn’t just <i class="calibre6">about</i> the Foldit players; it was <i class="calibre6">by</i> the Foldit players. More than 57,000 gamers were listed as official coauthors alongside Popović and his university colleagues.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en252" id="Ref-en252"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">25</sup><br class="calibre2"/>25</a></div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">IN THE DECADES</b> to come, there will be many more challenges for us to tackle together as crowds: more citizen journalism investigations, more collective intelligence projects, more humanitarian efforts, more citizen science research. There’s no shortage of world-changing collective work to be done—so we can’t allow ourselves to be limited by a shortage of incentive or compensation.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Many crowdsourcing projects today are experimenting with micropayments, or small amounts of monetary reward, in return for contributions. The Amazon Mechanical Turk marketplace, which gives businesses access to a global virtual workforce, pays participants a few cents for each helpful contribution to a <b class="calibre5">human intelligence task</b>, or HIT—a cognitive task “that only a human, and not a computer, could do” (such as labeling images, characterizing the emotional quality of song lyrics, or describing the action in short videos). Others offer prizes for top contributions. The CrowdSPRING marketplace, for example, offers prizes starting at $5,000 to individuals who submit the most helpful ideas—for example, helping name a new product or improve an existing service.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The logic behind these practices is that if people are willing to contribute for free, they’ll be even happier to contribute when they’re compensated. But compensating people for their contributions is <i class="calibre6">not</i> a good way to increase global participation bandwidth, for two key reasons.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">First, as numerous scientific studies have shown, compensation typically <i class="calibre6">decreases</i> motivation to engage in activities we would otherwise freely enjoy.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en253" id="Ref-en253"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">26</sup><br class="calibre2"/>26</a> If we are paid to do something we would otherwise have done out of interest—such as reading, drawing, participating in a survey, or solving puzzles—we are  less likely to do it in the future without being paid. Compensation increases participation only among groups who would never engage otherwise—and as soon as you stop paying them, they stop participating.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Second, there are natural limits on the monetary resources we can provide a community of participants. Any given project will have only so much financial capital to give away; even a successful business will eventually hit an upper limit of what it can afford to pay for contributions. Scarce rewards like money and prizes artificially limit the amount of participation a network can inspire and support.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We need a more <b class="calibre5">sustainable engagement economy</b>—an economy that works by motivating and rewarding participants with intrinsic rewards, and not more lucrative compensation.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So if not money or prizes, then what will most likely emerge as the most powerful currency in the crowdsourcing economy? I believe that emotions will drive this new economy. Positive emotions are the ultimate reward for participation. And we are already hardwired to produce all the rewards we could ever want—through positive activity, positive achievements, and positive relationships. It’s an infinitely renewable source of incentive to participate in big crowd projects.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In the engagement economy, we’re not competing for “eyeballs” or “mind-share.” We’re competing for brain cycles and heartshare. That’s why success in the new engagement economy won’t come from providing better or more competitive compensation. It will come from providing better and more <i class="calibre6">competitive engagement</i>—the kind of engagement that increases our personal and collective participation bandwidth by motivating us to do more, for longer, toward collective ends. And no one knows how to augment our collective capacity for engagement better than game developers.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Game designers have been honing the art of mass collaboration for years. Games inspire extreme effort. Games create communities that stick together over time, long enough to get amazing things done together. If crowdsourcing is the theory, then games are the platform.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Which brings us to our next fix for reality: <div class="afmtx1"><div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">FIX # 11 : A SUSTAINABLE ENGAGEMENT ECONOMY</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">Compared with games, reality is unsustainable. The gratifications we get from playing games are an infinitely renewable resource.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Good game developers know that the emotional experience itself is the reward. Consider the following job listing for Bungie, the company that creates the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> video game series:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">Do you dream about creating worlds imbued with real value and consequence? Can you find the fine line between a reward that encourages players to have fun and an incentive that enslaves them? Can you devise a way for a player to grow while preserving a delicate game balance? If you answered yes to these questions, you might want to polish up your résumé and apply to be Bungie’s next Player Investment Design Lead.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">The Player Investment Design Lead directs a group of designers responsible for founding a robust and rewarding investment path, supported by consistent, rich and secure incentives that drive player behavior toward having fun and investing in their characters, and then validates those systems through intense simulation, testing and iteration.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en254" id="Ref-en254"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">27</sup><br class="calibre2"/>27</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">This kind of job doesn’t yet exist outside of the game industry. But it should. “Player investment design lead” is a role that every single collaborative project or crowd initiative should fill in the future. When the game is intrinsically rewarding to play, you don’t have to pay people to participate—with real currency, virtual currency, or any other kind of scarce reward. Participation is its own reward, when the player is properly invested in his or her progress, in exploring the world fully, and in the community’s success.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So how exactly do you design good player investment? The Bungie job listing further details some of the core responsibilities of the position—and, in a nutshell, they give us a very good idea of four engagement principles any big crowd project should follow. As you can see, these four principles all serve the ultimate goal of building a compelling game world, satisfying game mechanics, and an inspiring game community.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx1"><b class="calibre5">The Player Investment Design Lead will design the mechanics that drive in-game player reward and incentives:</b> <div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• So players feel invested in the world and their character.</div><div class="lsl">• So players have long-term goals.</div><div class="lsl">• So players can’t grief or exploit them, or each other.</div><div class="lsl">• So that content are rewards in and of themselves.</div></div></div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In other words, participants should be able to explore and impact a “world,” or shared social space that features both content and interactive opportunities. They should be able to create and develop a unique identity within that world. They should see the bigger picture when it comes to doing work in the world—both an opportunity to escalate challenge and to continue working over time toward bigger results. The game must be carefully designed so that the only way to be rewarded is to participate in good faith, because in any game players will do anything they get the most rewarded for doing. And the emphasis must be on making the content and experience intrinsically rewarding, rather than on providing compensation for doing something that would otherwise feel boring, trivial, or pointless.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Do these principles work as effectively for real-world problem solving as for virtual-world problem solving? Absolutely. They are clearly the shared secret of the success for projects like Investigate Your MP’s Expenses, Wikipedia, Free Rice, and Fold It!. In each case, the experience of participation is rewarding on its own merits, immersing a player inside an interactive world that motivates and rewards his or her best effort.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Gamers who have grown up being intensely engaged by well-designed virtual environments are hungry for better forms of engagement in their real lives.  They’re seeking out ways to be blissfully productive while cooperating toward extreme-scale goals. They are a natural source of participation bandwidth for the kinds of citizen journalism, collective intelligence, humanitarian, and citizen science projects that we will increasingly seek to undertake.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As the examples in this chapter demonstrate, crowdsourcing games have an important role to play in how we achieve our democratic, scientific, and humanitarian goals over the next decade and beyond.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">And more and more, these crowdsourcing games won’t be just about online work or computational tasks. Increasingly, they will take us out into physical environments and face-to-face social spaces. These new games will challenge crowds to <i class="calibre6">mobilize</i> for real-world social missions—and they may make it possible for gamers to change, or even save, real people’s lives as easily as they save virtual lives today.</div>
