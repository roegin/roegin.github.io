<div class="fmht"><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</b></div>
<div class="fmht"><b class="calibre5">Saving the Real World Together</b></div>
<div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">W</b>e are living in a geological era that scientists dub the “anthropocene epoch,” from the Greek <i class="calibre6">anthropo</i>-, for “human,” and <i class="calibre6">-cene,</i> for “new” or “recent.” It’s the age of human impact on the earth.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Our impact is measurable in myriad ways: increasing levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, deforestation and continental erosion, a rising sea level. We may not have set out to remake the planet in any of these ways—but we have nonetheless. And now we must learn better ways of remaking it, this time with intention, discipline, and purpose.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As Steward Brand, author of <i class="calibre6">Whole Earth Discipline</i>, puts it, “Humanity is now stuck with a planet stewardship role.... We are as gods and <i class="calibre6">have</i> to get good at it.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en283" id="Ref-en283"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">1</sup><br class="calibre2"/>1</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Brand is perhaps best known as the founder of the <i class="calibre6">Whole Earth Catalog</i>, a countercultural catalog of “tools and ideas to shape the environment” published from 1968 to 1972. (When he launched that catalog, he wrote, “We are as gods and might as well get good at it.”)<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en284" id="Ref-en284"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">2</sup><br class="calibre2"/>2</a> In 1996 he cofounded the Long Now Foundation, a San Francisco-based foundation dedicated to long-term thinking and responsibility—for the earth, and for the survival of the human species—over the next ten thousand years and beyond. If we want to stay on  this planet for anywhere near that long, Brand says, we have to become better at strategically affecting our ecosystem. “We are forced to learn planet craft—in both senses of the word. Craft as skill and craft as cunning.” We not only have to master the ability to change how our ecosystem works, we also have to figure out the right ways to change it. And that won’t be easy.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">“The forces in play in the Earth system are astronomically massive and unimaginably complex,” Brand writes.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en285" id="Ref-en285"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">3</sup><br class="calibre2"/>3</a> “We’re facing multidecade, multigeneration problems and solutions. Accomplishing what is needed will take diligence and patience—a sustained <i class="calibre6">bearing down</i>, over human lifetimes, to bridge the long lag times and lead times in climate, biological, and social dynamics.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en286" id="Ref-en286"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">4</sup><br class="calibre2"/>4</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Fortunately for all of us, gamers actually have a head start on this mission.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Gamers have been mastering the art of planet craft for years. There’s actually a genre of computer games known as “god games”—world- and population-management simulations that give a single player the ability to shape the course of events on earth in dramatic ways, over lifetimes or longer.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As we’ve seen, Will Wright’s <i class="calibre6">The Sims</i> gives players godlike powers over the daily lives of individual people. Sid Meier’s <i class="calibre6">Civilization</i> challenges players to guide a civilization (such as the Aztecs, the Romans, the Americans, the Zulus) from the start of the Bronze Age, six thousand years ago, through the Space Age, or AD 2100. And Peter Molyneux’s <i class="calibre6">Black &amp; White</i> invites players to govern the entire biome of a remote island, inspiring either joyful worship or terrified obedience in the island’s tribal population by performing a combination of benevolent and evil divine ecological interventions.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">What all of these god games have in common is that they encourage players to practice the three skills that are critical for real planet craft: taking a long view, ecosystems thinking, and pilot experimentation.</div>
<div class="fmtx3"><b class="calibre5">Taking a long view</b> means working at scales far larger than we would ordinarily encounter in our day-to-day lives. Players of god games have to consider their moment-by-moment actions in the context of a very long future: an entire simulated human life, a single civilization’s rise and fall, or even the entire course of human history.</div>
<div class="fmtx3"><b class="calibre5">Ecosystems thinking</b> is a way of looking at the world as a complex web of interconnected, interdependent parts. A good ecosystems thinker will study  and learn how to anticipate the ways in which changes to one part of an ecosystem will impact other parts—often in surprising and far-reaching ways.</div>
<div class="fmtx3"><b class="calibre5">Pilot experimentation</b> is the process of designing and running many small tests of different strategies and solutions in order to discover the best course of action to take. When you’ve successfully tested a strategy, you can scale up your efforts to make a bigger impact. Since god gamers want to maximize their success, they don’t just come up with one plan and stick to it. Instead, they carefully feel their way around the system, poking and prodding until they find the strategies that seem to reliably maximize success.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Taken together, these three ways of thinking and acting are exactly the kinds of effort Brand recommends in <i class="calibre6">Whole Earth Discipline</i>. Instead of seizing the day, he says, “Seize the century.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en287" id="Ref-en287"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">5</sup><br class="calibre2"/>5</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">He advises, “Participation has to be subtle and tentative, and then cumulating in the right direction. If we make the right moves at the right time, all may yet be well.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en288" id="Ref-en288"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">6</sup><br class="calibre2"/>6</a></div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">OF COURSE,</b> we can’t actually use existing commercial computer games as test environments to solve the real problems we face. They radically simplify the forces at play in the complex ecosystems we live in. But as we try to develop systems for engaging massively many people in world-changing efforts, we can take an important cue from the most successful god games. Specifically, we can learn from their ability to change the way players think about the world, and their own powers within it.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Take, for example, the most epic god game yet designed—the universe simulation <i class="calibre6">Spore</i>, developed by Will Wright and produced by Maxis Software. Of all the god games to date, <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> is the most explicitly linked to the notion of planet craft—and the most intentionally focused on getting players to think of themselves as capable of changing the real world.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In <i class="calibre6">Spore</i>, players control the development of a unique species through five stages of evolution: from single-cell origins (stage one) into social, land-dwelling creatures (stage two), who form tribes (stage three), build technologically sophisticated civilizations (stage four), and ultimately venture off into  intergalactic space exploration (stage five). Each stage zooms out to give the player control over a more complex system. Players advance from manipulating cellular DNA to increasing their creature’s intelligent behaviors; from organizing a division of labor in their tribe to growing a global economy; from advancing national interests through trade, military action, or spiritual outreach to colonizing other planets and transforming them into inhabitable ecosystems. They can spend as much time as they want in any stage, piloting different strategies for improving their species and transforming the environment.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The game is fun and rewarding to play, but it’s meant to accomplish more than just relieving boredom or making us happy. As Wright has said on numerous occasions, the game is meant to spark a sense of <i class="calibre6">creative capability</i> among players, and to inspire them to adopt the kind of long-term, planetary outlook that can save the real world.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Consider this exchange, which occurred shortly after the 2008 release of <i class="calibre6">Spore</i>, when the popular science magazine <i class="calibre6">Seed</i> hosted a public salon between Wright and Jill Tarter, a noted astrobiologist. The topic of the salon: how games like <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> are preparing young people to take a more active role in reimagining the real world.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx1"><b class="calibre5">TARTER:</b> I keep thinking about the generation that’s getting exposed to all this wonderful, rich opportunity of game playing as education, and that they expect to be able to manipulate the real world the way they do the game world. How do we bridge that? How do we turn them into socially functioning members of humanity on one planet? [. . .]</div>
<div class="fmtx2">I’m eager to understand how learning to be good at a game makes you good at life, makes you good at changing the world, and gives you skills that are going to allow you to reinvent your environment.</div>
<div class="fmtx1"><b class="calibre5">WRIGHT:</b> Well . . . if there’s one aspect of humanity that I want to augment, it’s the imagination, which is probably our most powerful cognitive tool. I think of games as being an amplifier for  the imagination of the players, in the same way that a car amplifies our legs or a house amplifies our skin. [. . .]</div>
<div class="fmtx2">The human imagination is this amazing thing. We’re able to build models of the world around us, test out hypothetical scenarios, and, in some sense, simulate the world. I think this ability is probably one of the most important characteristics of humanity.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en289" id="Ref-en289"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">7</sup><br class="calibre2"/>7</a></div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Why does Wright believe that augmenting our natural capacity for imagination is so important at this precise moment in human history? It’s a matter of survival, pure and simple.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The name <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> is itself an important clue: the definition of a spore, in biology, is “a reproductive structure that is adapted for dispersal and surviving for extended periods of time in unfavorable conditions.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en290" id="Ref-en290"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">8</sup><br class="calibre2"/>8</a> It’s a perfect metaphor for the present circumstances of the human race.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We have collectively entered into what is all but certain to be a time of increasingly unfavorable planetary conditions, largely of our own making—an unstable climate, extreme weather, and an increasingly depleted environment. We need to adapt for survival. We need to imagine planetary-scale solutions and disperse them as far and wide as possible.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We need to become like spores ourselves.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">And there’s an explicit call to action to do so, for players who complete all five stages of the game successfully. <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> has what game developers call a “primary win condition”: a supergoal that represents the ultimate achievement in the game. The primary win condition in <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> is to develop your single-cell creature into such a successful intergalactic space-faring civilization that it eventually reaches one galactic destination in particular: a super-massive black hole at the center of the galaxy.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Players who reach the black hole receive a “staff of life,” which allows them to transform any planet in the <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> galaxy into a vibrant, diverse ecosystem: teeming with plants and creatures of all kinds, with breathable atmosphere, sustainable food webs, and plentiful water supply. (No wonder players also refer to it as the “Genesis device.”)</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The staff of life is a shortcut to making an otherwise uninhabitable planet inhabitable. Along with the staff of life, players receive a special message and mission:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">You have traveled very far and overcome many obstacles. Your creative efforts have not gone unnoticed. Your heroic efforts have proven you deserving, worthy of advancement to the next level of your existence. You are now to be given the power. Yes, that’s right, THE POWER. The power to create and spread life, intelligence and understanding throughout the cosmos. Use this power wisely. There is a wonderful opportunity to start on one particular planet: Look for the third rock from <i class="calibre6">Sol</i>.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3"><i class="calibre6">Sol</i> is Latin for “sun,” and so the <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> community has translated this final message from the game as a playful imperative to remake our own Earth—which is, of course, the third rock from our sun.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In the end, a win in <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> is a push back to the real world. Players are told, “Your gameplay has prepared you to become a real creator and protector of life on Earth.” Not by making them an expert in geoengineering, atmospheric science, or ecological planning, certainly, but rather by creating the seed of planetary creativity and activism. As Wright said at the <i class="calibre6">Seed</i> salon:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">All of the really tough problems we’re facing now are planetary problems. There’s real value in being pushed toward global awareness and looking long-term. That’s one of the things that I find very useful about games.... I think these are the timelines we need to be looking at—the one-hundred- or two-hundred-year horizons. Because most of the really bad stuff that’s happening right now is the result of very short-term thinking.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We can break free of the cognitive chains of short-term isolated thinking, with games that direct our collective attention to the future and challenge us to take a global perspective.</div>
<div class="centeraligned"><img alt="013" class="imgepub1" src="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_013_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">GOD GAMES LIKE</b> <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> have gotten us successfully started on this journey. Now a different genre of games can get us where we need to go: massively multiplayer forecasting games, or <b class="calibre5">forecasting games</b> for short.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Forecasting games combine collective intelligence with planetary-scale simulation. They ask players to reimagine and reinvent the way we feed ourselves, the way we transport ourselves, the way we get water, the way we design cities, the way we manufacture everything, the way we power our lives. They’re designed to create diverse communities capable of investigating the long-term challenges we face, propose imaginative solutions, and coordinate our efforts to start putting our best ideas into action at the planetary scale.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s a process I call <b class="calibre5">massively multiplayer foresight</b>. And future-forecasting games are the perfect tool for helping as many people participate in the process as possible.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en291" id="Ref-en291"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">9</sup><br class="calibre2"/>9</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Which brings us to our final fix for reality:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">FIX # 14 : MASSIVELY MULTIPLAYER FORESIGHT</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">Reality is stuck in the present. Games help us imagine and invent the future together.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">How exactly does massively multiplayer foresight work? The best way to understand the process is to start with the project that inspired the forecasting game genre.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">World Without Oil: Play It Before You Live It</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1"><i class="calibre6">You know it’s bad for you.</i> <br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre6">You’ll cut back someday.</i> <br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre6">On April 30, join a World Without Oil—and play it before you live it.</i></div>
<div class="fmtx1">—Announcement for the game</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In April 2007, the world ran out of oil.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It didn’t run completely out of oil—it simply ran out of <i class="calibre6">enough</i> oil. The daily demand for oil worldwide began to outpace our daily production capacity. Shortages broke out, reserves were tapped, and yet the gap between global supply and demand grew wider.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The United States was among the hardest countries hit. During the darkest days of the crisis, as many as 22 percent of Americans were unable to get access to gas, while one in ten U.S. companies buckled under the strain of higher fuel costs and diminished operating capacity.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Two main strategies emerged to deal with the oil crisis.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We could collectively reduce our daily demand for petroleum in order to create equilibrium with the available supply.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Or we could compete even more aggressively for the available oil—with our own individual neighbors, with other companies, with other states, and with other countries.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Of course, this didn’t really happen—at least not for most of us.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But for two thousand online gamers, this peak-oil scenario was the basis for a life-changing six-week experiment: a collaborative simulation designed to find out what <i class="calibre6">would</i> happen if demand for oil did eventually outstrip our supply, and what we could collectively do about it.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The project was called World Without Oil (WWO), and it was the first massively scaled effort to engage ordinary individuals in creating an immersive forecast of the future.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">HOW TO PLAY WORLD WITHOUT OIL</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">At heart World Without Oil is very simple. It’s a “What if?” game.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">What if an oil crisis started today—what would happen? How would the lives of ordinary people change?</div>
<div class="fmtx2">What would you do to survive the crisis? How would you help others?</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Let’s play “What if?” and find out.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Create your own story of life during the oil crisis—and share it with us by e-mail or by phone call, by photos or by blog post, by videos or podcasts.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Then join our citizen “nerve center” at <a href="http://worldwithoutoil.org">worldwithoutoil.org<br class="calibre2"/>Worldwithoutoil.org 世界无劳工组织</a> to track events and share solutions. Every day, we’ll update you with news about the crisis, and highlight our favorite stories from across the country and around the world.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">No expert knows better than you do how an oil shock could impact your family, your job, your town, your life. So tell us what you know.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Because the best way to change the future is to play with it first.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Funded by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and presented by the Independent Television Service (ITVS), World Without Oil was first conceived by Ken Eklund, an independent writer and interactive developer based in San Jose, California. He pitched the idea in response to an ITVS announcement of funds up to $100,000 being made available for innovative educational online games. I was invited by ITVS to serve on the evaluating committee for online game proposals.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">“No one today has a clear picture of oil availability or what will happen when demand inevitably outstrips supply,” Eklund wrote in his proposal. “That will largely depend on how well ordinary people respond to the crisis. Until now, no one has ever thought to ask them what they might do. WWO will evoke the wisdom of crowds in advance, as players work together to gain grassroots insights into the forces that will rule at street level in a crisis—and figure out the best ways to prepare, cooperate, and collectively create solutions if and when a real peak-oil shortage happens.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It was designed as a massively multiplayer thought experiment: players would spend six weeks imagining how such a crisis might play out in their local communities, their industries, and their own lives. They would make  highly personal forecasts using online social media. And they would rely on an “alternate reality dashboard” to get daily updates on the scenario, in the form of fictional news stories, video reports, and economic indicators from the peak-oil crisis in order to flesh out their personal forecasts in more detail.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Players would also be strongly encouraged to take the simulation a step further, and spend some time each day living their real lives as if the simulated oil shortage were true. How hard would it be to get to work, or to prepare dinner, or to see friends and family if the fictional simulation were real? Players were challenged to test their own ability to adapt, rapidly and dramatically, to a potential oil crisis. Instead of just imagining a peak-oil scenario, they could start making changes and testing adaptive solutions for real.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Each day in real time would represent a week in the simulation. This would enable players to consider longer-term impacts and strategies. The game itself would last for thirty-two days, so the scenario could play out over thirty-two weeks.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">WWO would give players firsthand insight into a plausible future, helping them prepare for, or even prevent, its worst outcomes. The game would also create a collective record of how a real peak-oil scenario might play out—a kind of survival guide for the future, a record of tremendous value for educators, policy makers, and organizations of all kinds.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">I happily accepted Eklund’s invitation to join the project team as the game’s “participation architect”—a fancy way of saying my job was to help make sure every single player found a way to contribute meaningfully to the collaborative effort.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Of course, to start, we had to attract a community of players. I set our target at one thousand players, a number based on my experience with online communities and collective intelligence. One thousand participants seems to me to be a critical threshold to allow for an online game to get interesting—to ensure enough diversity among players, to have enough participants to tackle missions on an epic scale, and to produce enough chaotic interaction to generate complex and surprising results.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">For six weeks before we launched, we spread the word online and at public  events. We asked our friends and colleagues to blog about it. I announced the game in my keynote for the Serious Games Summit, an annual two-day meeting in San Francisco for people working on games designed to teach, train, and solve real problems. ITVS reached out to educators and media creators across the country. There wasn’t any other marketing plan or promotional budget for the game. It was simply an open, public invitation to simulate the future, and the game was free to play.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So who showed up to play? They numbered just over nineteen hundred (nearly doubling our initial goal), evenly divided between men and women, and representing all fifty United States and a dozen countries abroad. Most players were in their twenties or thirties, but there were notable clusters of every age group, from teenagers to seniors. And our most active players brought together an astonishingly diverse range of personal concerns and real-life expertise to the game. For example:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• Peakprophet, a self-described “hobby farmer” in Tennessee, who forecast the collapse of the fresh-food supply chain—and then took it upon himself to train other players how to grow their own food and increase their food self-sufficiency.</div><div class="lsl">• Lead_tag, a soldier stationed in Iraq, who blogged every single day of the game, creating a series of thirty-two reflections on the challenges of fighting a war during an oil crisis.</div><div class="lsl">• Anda, a college student pursuing a bachelor of fine arts in graphic design at the San Francisco Art Institute, who created a series of eleven Japanese manga-style Web comics about how she and her friends would help each other during the oil crisis, and how it might affect their ability to find work after graduation.</div><div class="lsl">• OrganizedChaos, a dispatcher at a General Motors plant in Detroit, who contributed fifty-five blog posts, videos, and podcasts, and found herself forecasting that pretty soon—peak oil or not—she would no longer have a job. As a result, at the end of the game she decided to go back to school in real life to prepare for a new career in a postoil economy.</div></div></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Once we’d assembled our forecasting community, it was crucial for us that a significant portion of our players stay engaged with the game for its entire six-week duration. That’s because when it comes to future forecasting, our first ideas are often the most obvious and generalized, and therefore the least useful. It takes a while, even for an experienced forecaster, to drill down to the most interesting specifics and spin off unexpected possibilities. So we adopted several strategies to keep players engaged and actively investigating different aspects of the scenario.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">First, each game day we added a new piece of information to the mix: rolling brownouts from oil-dependent power companies; airlines canceling flights and dramatically raising the cost of tickets; empty shelves and food shortages due to inability of deliveries to be made to local stores. In return, players told us about difficulties dealing with unreliable power at home; business travelers getting stranded in other countries when airports unexpectedly shut down; public transportation overcrowding in towns and cities with previously underutilized systems; a disruptive uptick in work-from-home days; the rise of bicycle thefts and a new bicycle black market; impromptu homeschooling as a result of gas shortages in suburban and rural areas; and neighborhood pot-luck meals to deal with the food shortage.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Another important tool for continuing participation was our alternate reality dashboard, which included a map depicting thirty-eight different regions, such as the Boston metro area, the Cincinnati-Columbus metro area, the Great Lakes, the High Plains, and the Atlantic South, each with its own set of “power meters” reflecting the local rise and fall in quality of life, economic strength, and social stability. The power meters fluctuated in direct response to player activity. The more positive forecasts they made, the more cooperative strategies they developed, and the more actively they reduced their own collective daily oil consumption, the more favorable the regional metrics. However, if players chose to imagine a darker turn of events, or if they chose to focus on how increased competition might play out, or if they reported significant difficulties or hardships in adapting to a lower-consumption lifestyle, the metrics would reflect increased chaos, rising misery, or even economic collapse. The meters created a clear feedback loop between players’ stories and the scenario updates.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Of course, the sizable online audience that assembled for World Without Oil was also a huge incentive for players to tell the best stories possible. For every active forecaster, we had an additional twenty-five people watching the game and writing about it. This amplification of their ideas helped make the players’ efforts feel more meaningful.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In the end, the game produced more than a hundred thousand online media artifacts—including a core set of more than two thousand future-forecasting documents from the players and tens of thousands more blog posts and articles reflecting on the game and its findings. One reviewer called it a “huge growing, twisting network of news, strategy, activism, and personal expression.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en292" id="Ref-en292"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">10</sup><br class="calibre2"/>10</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">At first, the majority of players focused their efforts on imagining how local, regional, and international competition for oil resources would play out in this new environment of increased scarcity. They exercised a dark imagination, anticipating the worst possible outcomes and the most serious threats. They documented gas theft, riots, food shortages, widespread looting, job loss, school closures, and even military actions worldwide. At a more personal level, they told stories of personal stress, anxiety, and families in crisis.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But over the course of thirty-two weeks, the balance shifted. About halfway through the game, having exhausted their dark imagination, players began focusing on potential solutions. They started imagining best-case-scenario outcomes: new ways of cooperating to consume less, a focus on local community and neighborhood infrastructure, less time spent commuting, the geographic reassembly of extended family, and more time spent in pursuit of a new American dream—happiness built around notions of sustainability, simplicity, and stronger social connectivity.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The game started with near-apocalyptic undertones; it ended with explicit, if cautious, optimism. The best-case-scenario outcomes were posed not as probabilities—and certainly not as inevitabilities—but rather as <i class="calibre6">plausible</i> possibilities worth working toward.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">There was no explicit prompt to start with dark imagination and only later veer toward optimism. But it is, in fact, a very sound forecasting strategy.  Researchers have pointed to a particularly American failure to believe that the worst can really happen, because we’re systematically trained by our culture to focus on the positive. It’s a failure that makes us more susceptible to catastrophic events, like Hurricane Katrina or the 2008 housing market collapse, for example. In <i class="calibre6">Never Saw It Coming</i>, sociologist Karen Cerulo argues that our collective inability to focus on negative futures is our culture’s biggest blind spot.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en293" id="Ref-en293"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">11</sup><br class="calibre2"/>11</a> As one reviewer of Cerulo’s book summed it up: “We are individually, institutionally, and societally hell-bent on wishful thinking.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en294" id="Ref-en294"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">12</sup><br class="calibre2"/>12</a> We are very good at positive thinking, but we tend to avoid articulating worst-case scenarios, which unfortunately makes us more vulnerable to them and less resilient if they occur.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">World Without Oil gave players a space for nonwishful thinking; that’s what created a sense of urgency to find solutions. That mind-set also lent a sense of gravitas and realism to even the most hopeful stories players told later in the game—stories we later compiled into a guide, “A to Z: A World Beyond Oil.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en295" id="Ref-en295"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">13</sup><br class="calibre2"/>13</a> It contains some of the most interesting community solutions players devised and can give you a taste of how massively multifaceted the final collaborative forecast was. Here are a few of my favorite topics from the document:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• Architecture Without Oil—notes from attendees of a national architecture convention on how to design and build homes for a world without oil</div><div class="lsl">• Fellowship Without Oil—a collection of sermons and prayers from pastors, ministers, and other spiritual leaders offering guidance for how to act compassionately during the oil crisis</div><div class="lsl">• Neighborhood Without Oil—guidelines for how to build stronger personal relationships with our geographically closest neighbors, the people most likely to be of assistance to us during an oil crisis</div><div class="lsl">• Your Mama Without Oil—reflections from mothers of young children on how to parent in a world without oil</div><div class="lsl">• Zoom Zoom Without Oil—conversations among automotive racing  fans about the future of NASCAR and potential partnerships with alternative vehicle races, including electric vehicle races and human-powered vehicle races</div></div></div>
<div class="fmtx3">“The forecasts are of astonishing quality,” one reviewer said of WWO afterward. “The players got to the heart of a complex subject.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en296" id="Ref-en296"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">14</sup><br class="calibre2"/>14</a> I think “heart” is a key word here, because players were telling stories about the futures they cared about most—the future of their industry, their religion, or their own town and their children.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">After the game, creative director Ken Eklund reflected on what it had accomplished. “WWO didn’t only raise awareness about oil dependence. It roused our democratic imagination. It made the issues <i class="calibre6">real</i>, and this in turn led to real engagement and real change in people’s lives. Via the game, players made themselves better citizens.” This is clearly evident in what players reported afterward. One player reported:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">I really mean it when I say WWO changed my life. I really have been using my cloth bags at the stores, walking more/driving less, turning off lights, and, yes, recycling. My friends, family and coworkers have all noticed the difference. In all seriousness, this entire thing has made me a different person. <a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en297" id="Ref-en297"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">15</sup><br class="calibre2"/>15岁</a></div>

<div class="fmtx3">Today, the entire simulation has been preserved in a sort of online time machine at <a href="http://Worldwithoutoil.org">Worldwithoutoil.org<br class="calibre2"/>Worldwithoutoil.org 无劳力世界组织</a>, where you can experience the game from day one all the way through day thirty-two. Each day of gameplay is captured in time so you can see exactly how the collaboration unfolded; there are also guidelines for playing the game yourself today—on your own, with your family, with colleagues, with a classroom, or with your neighbors. In fact, the simulation has been repeated many times at a smaller scale to help individuals and communities prepare themselves, and invent their own solutions, for living in a world beyond oil.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">PERHAPS YOU’RE WONDERING</b>—as many people have asked me since—why did the players participate?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Why would anyone want to play a serious game like World Without Oil instead of a fantasy game, an escapist game, a completely feel-good game?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">I asked myself the same question—before WWO launched, while it was being played and afterward, even when we had proof that players were enjoying themselves and audiences found it compelling to watch the project unfold.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Here’s what I’ve come to believe about a game like WWO. By turning a real problem into a voluntary obstacle, we activated more genuine interest, curiosity, motivation, effort, and optimism than we would have otherwise. We can change our real-life behaviors in the context of a fictional game precisely because there isn’t any negative pressure surrounding the decision to change. We are motivated purely by positive stress and by our own desire to engage with a game in more satisfying, successful, social, and meaningful ways.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">I also firmly believe that many gamers want to do something that matters in the real world as much as their efforts matter in the game world. One player summed this up best:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">Looking back at World Without Oil, I think it is the most amazing, best multiplayer game I have experienced. Usually gaming takes time away from accomplishing useful things in real life, but WWO  taught me a lot, lowered my electric bill, and got me focused on doing things that matter to me. <a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en299" id="Ref-en299"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">17</sup><br class="calibre2"/>17</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Gamers are ready and willing to take on challenges outside of strictly virtual environments. Meanwhile, people who don’t ordinarily play games are happy to do so when it can help make a difference in the real world.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The numbers are still small. Two thousand players doesn’t begin to compare with <i class="calibre6">Spore</i>’s active community of more than a million. But unlike <i class="calibre6">Spore</i>, which represents roughly two decades of some of the smartest computer programmers, some of the most creative game designers, and some of the most brilliant artists in the world working together to advance the genre of planetary simulation and god games (<i class="calibre6">SimEarth</i> was released in 1990), we are essentially still in the <i class="calibre6">Pong</i> days of future-forecasting games. (With the operating budget of <i class="calibre6">Pong</i> to boot.)</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We are <i class="calibre6">Pong</i>, competing with <i class="calibre6">Spore</i>. It’s not much of a matchup yet.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But as the field attracts more of the world’s best programmers, storytellers, designers, and artists, as more people are exposed to these games and learn how to play them, and as we invest millions, rather than thousands, of dollars in developing these future worlds, we will grow our future world-building skills just as we’ve grown our virtual world-building skills over the past thirty years. With enough attention and investment, we will start to create immersive future environments as engaging as our favorite virtual worlds.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">WORLD WITHOUT OIL</b> changed the lives of many of our players—but it was also a life-changing experience for me.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It was the proof-of-concept game that convinced me we really can save the real world with the right kind of game. It’s the project that inspired me to define my biggest hope for the future: that a game developer would soon be worthy of a Nobel Prize.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">I’ve since taken to advertising that goal everywhere I go, in the hopes of inspiring other game developers to join me in my mission. Of course, both inside and outside the game industry, when I suggest the idea, I’m often met  with skepticism. How could a game possibly accomplish enough real-world good to warrant such a prize?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Even on the heels of a project as promising as World Without Oil, it’s true that winning a Nobel Prize is a fairly bold ambition. But consider this: Albert Einstein, who won his own Nobel Prize in physics in 1921, once famously said, “Games are the most elevated form of investigation.” This quotation appears in multiple biographies of Einstein and circulates widely in various collections of famous sayings, but, interestingly, its origins remain elusive. No one seems to have recorded the context of Einstein’s statement—when or where he said it, or what he meant by it. Why would an esteemed physicist call <i class="calibre6">games</i>, and not <i class="calibre6">science</i>, the most elevated form of investigation? It’s an unsolved mystery—one I’ve spent much of my free time puzzling over.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Although of course I can’t say for sure I’ve solved the mystery, I do have a theory. And it comes directly from working on World Without Oil.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Einstein, we know from many biographers, was a gamer—albeit a sometimes reluctant one. He had a lifelong love-hate relationship with the game of chess. He played it enthusiastically as a child, although he gave it up for much of his adult life, even once insisting to the <i class="calibre6">New York Times</i>, “I do not play any games. There is no time for it. When I get through work I don’t want anything which requires the working of the mind.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en300" id="Ref-en300"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">18</sup><br class="calibre2"/>18岁</a> Yet many friends and colleagues recall playing countless games of chess with Einstein, particularly later in his life.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Historians have suggested that Einstein avoided chess during the height of his scientific career precisely because he loved it so much and found it so distracting. “Chess holds its master in its own bonds,” he once said, “shackling the mind and brain.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en301" id="Ref-en301"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">19</sup><br class="calibre2"/>19</a> In other words, when he started thinking about chess, he found himself unable to stop. Why? Most likely because, as so many chess masters have noted, the game is an incredibly compelling problem that becomes more compelling the longer you think about it.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The central problem of chess is perfectly constructed, clear, and constrained : how do you manipulate a set of sixteen resources of different abilities in order to capture your opponent’s most valuable asset, while simultaneously protecting your own? But it can be approached with endlessly many different  strategies, each strategic effort changing the future possibilities in the problem space. As one famous chess saying goes, “Chess is infinite.”</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx1">There are 400 different positions after each player makes one move apiece. There are 72,084 positions after two moves apiece. There are 9-plus million positions after three moves apiece. There are 288-plus billion different possible positions after four moves apiece. There are more potential games than the number of electrons in our universe.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en302" id="Ref-en302"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">20</sup><br class="calibre2"/>20</a></div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The possibility space of chess is so massive and complex, one individual has no hope of understanding or exploring it fully—even if one spends a lifetime, as many chess players do, investigating it.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Fortunately, while chess is a two-player game, it is also a massively multiplayer project. The global community of chess players has collaborated for centuries to explore and document its problem space as thoroughly and imaginatively as possible. Indeed, for as long as modern players have played chess, they have recorded their games, shared strategies, formalized successful approaches, and published them for others’ benefit. Even after centuries of collective play, the chess community continues to seek a better understanding of the problem, to invent more surprising and successful approaches, and to hold the massively many possibilities of the game in their head as they drive the sum human understanding of the game forward, one move at a time.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To play chess as a more than casual player is to become a part of this problem-solving network. It means joining a massively collaborative effort to become intimately familiar with an otherwise unfathomably complex possibility space. And that’s what I believe Einstein meant when he described games as an elevated form of investigation. When enough people play a game, it becomes a massively collaborative study of a problem, an extreme-scale test of potential action in a specific possibility space.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">I believe that’s the direction we’re heading with forecasting games. These games help us identify a real-world problem and study it from massively multiple  points of view. They present the problem in a compelling way, and they help us compile a record of massively multiple strategies for addressing it. They give us a safe space to play out the possible consequences of each and every possible move we could make. And they help us anticipate the massively multiple moves that others could conceivably take.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">That’s actually what we tried to do with World Without Oil. We defined a problem: an oil shortage, with no available means of increasing supply. There was a clear goal: to resolve the imbalance between supply and demand. The possible strategies were infinite. We asked players to craft their own strategies, based on their own unique points of view: a combination of location, age, life experience, and personal values. We asked them to test, on a local scale, different actions, and to report their findings. Taken together, all the players’ stories and solutions represent massively multiple perspectives on the same problem. It was a truly elevated investigation.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">And in a world of changing climate, geopolitical tensions, and economic instabilities, there are plenty more problems to be tackled with our collective imagination.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">If we can develop the same kind of intelligence about the real problems we face as players do about their favorite games, then we <i class="calibre6">will</i> be able to practice better planet craft. We’ll elevate our collective understanding of the challenges we face. And we’ll build a global community of individuals ready to play a role in discerning the right moves to make in the future.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">At the end of World Without Oil, I was struck by how optimistic players were. Despite having spent nearly a month imagining incredibly dark forecasts, our players wound up feeling better—not worse—about the future and their ability to impact it. They experienced a sense of improved capability, greater resilience, and realistic hope.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In other words, they became what futurist Jamais Cascio calls “super-empowered hopeful individuals,” or SEHIs.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en303" id="Ref-en303"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">21</sup><br class="calibre2"/>二十一岁</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">A <b class="calibre5">SEHI</b> (pronounced <i class="calibre6">SEH-hee</i>) is someone who feels not just optimistic about the future, but also <i class="calibre6">personally capable</i> of changing the world for the better. According to Cascio, SEHIs get their confidence from network  technologies that amplify and aggregate individual ability to impact the common good.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Cascio coined the term “SEHI” in contrast to another term, “super-empowered angry men,” which <i class="calibre6">New York Times</i> columnist Thomas Friedman used in his writing about terrorism in a globally networked age. Osama bin Laden, Friedman wrote, seeks to create super-empowered angry men who feel capable of leaving their mark on the world, in terrible ways.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en304" id="Ref-en304"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">22</sup><br class="calibre2"/>22</a> In response, Cascio explains:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">The core of the “super-empowered angry individual” (SEAI) argument is that some technologies may enable individuals or small groups to carry out attacks, on infrastructure or people, at a scale that would have required the resources of an army in decades past.... But angry people aren’t the only ones who could be empowered by these technologies. As a parallel, the core of the “super-empowered hopeful individual” (SEHI) argument is that these technologies may also enable individuals or small groups to carry out socially beneficial actions at a scale that would have required the resources of a large NGO or business in decades past.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en305" id="Ref-en305"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">23</sup><br class="calibre2"/>23</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">SEHIs don’t wait around for the world to save itself. They invent and spread their own humanitarian missions. More importantly, they are “able to do so with smaller numbers, greater speed, and a far larger impact” than a slow-moving, risk-averse organization. Of course, in an ideal world, SEHIs would be able to band together and scale up their efforts—to avoid making redundant efforts, to learn from each other’s mistakes, to amplify each other’s abilities to make a difference. Disorganized SEHIs would have a hard time making significant strides. But organized SEHIs—well, they could change everything.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So a year after the World Without Oil experiment, Cascio and I teamed up at the Institute for the Future to find as many of those millions of SEHIs as possible—to give them a platform for organizing, and a new game to play.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It was called Superstruct, and its promise was simple: Play the game, invent the future.</div>
<div class="calibre2"><a id="h1"><br class="calibre2"/></a></div>
<h1 class="h"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Superstruct: Inventing the Future of Organization</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
超结构: 创造组织的未来</h1>
<div class="fmtx">Every year, the Institute for the Future produces a Ten-Year Forecast. It’s a look ahead at the next decade, to identify new economic forces, social practices, and changing environmental realities that will impact the way leading businesses, governments, and nonprofit organizations work, and to define the new challenges they’ll face. As we like to say at IFTF, “Ten years is a good, useful horizon—distant enough to expect real changes, close enough to feel within our grasp.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en306" id="Ref-en306"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">24</sup><br class="calibre2"/>24</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Each Ten-Year Forecast (TYF) has a defining theme, a driving question. In 2008, the TYF program director Kathi Vian decided that the driving question for the next year’s forecast would be: What is the future of scale for human organization?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Clearly, we were embarking on a decade of extreme-scale challenges: economic collapse, pandemics, climate change, the continuing risk of global terrorism, and disruptions to our global food supply chain, to name just a few. We knew that existing organizations would have to reinvent themselves in order to simply survive, let alone make a difference.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">“We know that the old ways of organizing the human race aren’t enough anymore. They’re not adapted to the highly connected world we’re living in. They’re not fast enough, or collaborative enough, or agile enough,” Vian wrote during our early brainstorming meetings. “We need to design better ways for the world to work together in the future. We need networked organizations that can solve problems better, move faster, be more responsive, and overcome the old ways of doing and thinking that paralyze us.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So we wanted to find out: How might businesses, governments, and nonprofit organizations team up to make each other more resilient during crisis? How could existing organizations work together to tackle these planetary-scale problems? How should these entities engage the super-empowered individuals who want to be a part of changing the world—and who will go it alone, for better or for worse, if they don’t feel engaged?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Our hunch was that surviving the next decade would require entirely new  ways of cooperating, coordinating, and creating together. So we wanted to find a new strategic language for talking about revolutionary ways of working together at extreme scales—language that could completely shift our thinking about how to adapt for the coming decade.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We looked at a lot of potential language, but as soon as we hit on the term “superstruct,” we knew we’d found it.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx1"><b class="calibre5">superstruct</b>/ˈsüprˌstrkt/</div>
<div class="fmtx2">verb trans. [L. <i class="calibre6">superstructus</i>, p.p. of <i class="calibre6">superstruere</i>, to build upon; <i class="calibre6">super-</i>, over + -<i class="calibre6">struere</i>, to build. See <i class="calibre6">super</i>-, and <i class="calibre6">structure</i>.]</div>
<div class="fmtx2">To build over or upon another structure; to erect upon a foundation.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en307" id="Ref-en307"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">25</sup><br class="calibre2"/>25</a></div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">“Superstruct” is a term that shows up most often in the fields of engineering and architecture. To superstruct a building is to extend it, to make it more resilient.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Superstructing isn’t about just making something bigger. It’s about working with an existing foundation and taking it in new directions, to reach beyond present limits. It means creating flexible connections to other structures, to mutually reinforce each other. And superstructing means growing in strategic and inventive ways so that you can create new and more powerful structures that would have been previously unimaginable.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So <i class="calibre6">superstruct</i> really seemed to capture the process of extension and reinvention that we wanted to explore in our Ten-Year Forecast. But what would be the best way to investigate a process that didn’t quite exist yet?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">My graduate studies background is in a social science called “performance studies,” in which one of the core research methodologies is to actually <i class="calibre6">do</i>, or <i class="calibre6">perform</i>, the thing that you’re studying. So we decided to build a superstructure.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We decided to superstruct our own Ten-Year Forecasting project by opening it up to the public. We would conduct our primary TYF research as a live, online six-week collaborative experiment—completely open to anyone who wanted to join us.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We called this experiment, naturally, Superstruct, and we framed it as a massively multiplayer forecasting game. We wanted the world to help us forecast the future of organizing at extreme, or epic, scales in order to survive real global threats and solve real planetary-scale problems. And we committed to using whatever collective forecast our players came up with as the foundation for our annual research report and conference the following spring.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The core creative team for the project was made up of program director Kathi Vian, scenario director Jamais Cascio, and myself, the game director. We spent six months working with a team of a dozen additional IFTF researchers and designers to develop the 2019 scenario, research the game topics, create the immersive content, design the gameplay, and build the website.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The game launched on September 22, 2008, with a press release from a fictional organization called the Global Extinction Awareness System. The press release was dated September 22, 2019.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx1"><i class="calibre6">For immediate release:</i> <br class="calibre2"/>September 22, 2019 <br class="calibre2"/>Humans have 23 years to go</div>
<div class="fmtx1"><i class="calibre6">Global Extinction Awareness System starts the countdown for Homo sapiens.</i></div>
<div class="fmtx2">Based on the results of a yearlong supercomputer simulation, the Global Extinction Awareness System (GEAS) has reset the “survival horizon” for <i class="calibre6">Homo sapiens—</i>the human race—from “indefinite” to 23 years.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">“The survival horizon identifies the point in time after which a threatened population is expected to experience a catastrophic collapse,” GEAS president Audrey Chen said. “It is the point from which a species is unlikely to recover. By identifying a survival horizon of 2042, GEAS has given human civilization a definite deadline for making substantive changes to planet and practices.”</div>
<div class="fmtx2">According to Chen, the latest GEAS simulation harnessed over 70 petabytes of environmental, economic, and demographic data, and was cross-validated by ten different probabilistic models.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">The GEAS models revealed a potentially terminal combination of five so-called “superthreats,” which represent a collision of environmental, economic, and social risks.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">“Each superthreat on its own poses a serious challenge to the world’s adaptive capacity,” said GEAS research director Hernandez Garcia. “Acting together, the five superthreats may irreversibly overwhelm our species’ ability to survive.”</div>
<div class="fmtx2">GEAS notified the United Nations prior to making a public announcement. The spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Vaira Vike-Freiberga released the following statement: “We are grateful for GEAS’ work, and we treat their latest forecast with seriousness and profound gravity.”</div>
<div class="fmtx2">GEAS urges concerned citizens, families, corporations, institutions, and governments to talk to each other and begin making plans to deal with the superthreats.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We chose an intentionally provocative starting point for the scenario for several reasons. First, we wanted players to propose awe-inspiring solutions. So we had to pose a scenario that would inspire a sense of awe and wonder—an epic “What if?” What would you do if you woke up one morning to discover that the world’s most trusted supercomputer had calculated the entire human species was as endangered as tigers, polar bears, and pandas are today?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Second, we wanted to learn something new, so we had to push our players to imagine previously unthinkable ideas. We aimed to create a forecasting context so far from their ordinary day-to-day concerns that they would feel free to practice extreme creativity and be comfortable pitching “outlier,” or unexpected, ideas.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">And third, we wanted to give our players a clear goal, a way to measure their success in the game. The GEAS survival horizon gave us the perfect way to do both. We would challenge our players to work together to extend the survival horizon from the year 2042 as far as we could possibly take it. Each year they added to the horizon would represent a significant milestone in the game. (Advances in the survival horizon would be based on an algorithm factoring in the number of active players, how many game missions they completed, and how many achievements they unlocked.)</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To ground the game in some specific forecasting topics, we identified five key areas in which players could make a significant impact on our survival horizon. These were the five superthreats, extreme-scale challenges that posed the greatest threat to humanity’s survival. But they weren’t just threats—they were also opportunities, key areas for coordinated effort and innovation, among organizations and SEHIs alike.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">If you wanted to make a difference in our game world of 2019, you had to pick one of these superthreats and start tackling it with the biggest, most surprising ideas you could come up with. These were the five superthreats:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• <i class="calibre6">Quarantine</i> covers the global response to declining health and pandemic disease, including the current respiratory distress syndrome (ReDS) crisis. The challenge: How can we protect and improve our global health, especially in the face of pandemics?</div><div class="lsl">• <i class="calibre6">Ravenous</i> focuses on the imminent collapse of the global food system, leading to food safety lapses and shortages worldwide. The challenge: How can we feed ourselves in more sustainable and secure ways?</div><div class="lsl">• <i class="calibre6">Power Struggle</i> follows the tremendous political and economic upheaval, as well as quality-of-life disruptions, we may suffer as we attempt to move from oil-based societies to solar, wind, and biofuel societies. The challenge: How can we reinvent the way we create and consume energy?</div><div class="lsl">• <i class="calibre6">Outlaw Planet</i> tracks the efforts to hack, grief, terrorize, or otherwise  exploit the communications, sensor, and data networks we increasingly rely on to run our lives. The challenge: How can we be more secure in a globally networked society?</div><div class="lsl">• <i class="calibre6">Generation Exile</i> looks at the difficulties of organizing society and government in the face of one particular challenge: the disappearance of secure habitats for three hundred million refugees and migrants, who have been forced to leave their homes and in many cases their homelands due to climate change, economic disruption, and war. The challenge: How can we govern ourselves and take better care of each other across traditional geopolitical borders?</div></div></div>
<div class="fmtx3">To help players quickly grasp the details of this complex scenario, for each of these superthreats we created a short video trailer and a series of news headlines describing unfolding events. We also released an online report, set in the year 2019, outlining some of the dilemmas each of these superthreats might provoke, and how they might interact with and magnify each other. In the report, we emphasized a sense of optimism about humanity’s ability to overcome the superthreats.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx1">The human species has a long history of overcoming tremendous obstacles, often coming out stronger than before. Indeed, some anthropologists argue that human intelligence emerged as the consequence of the last major ice age, a period of enormous environmental stress demanding flexibility, foresight, and creativity on the part of the small numbers of early <i class="calibre6">Homo sapiens</i>. Historically, those who have prophesied doom for human civilization have been proven wrong, time and again, by the capacity of our species to both adapt to and transform our conditions.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">GEAS does not argue or believe that this future is unavoidable. This is perhaps the most important element of our forecast. This is not <i class="calibre6">fate</i>. If we act now—and act with intelligence, flexibility,  foresight, and creativity—we can avoid the final threat. We may even come out of this period far stronger than we were before.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Both the report and the trailers ended with the same call to action: Join us to invent the future of the human species. We announced that volunteers were gathering on an online social network site called Superstruct. And we issued a public invitation—on blogs, on Facebook, on e-mail, on Twitter—to join the network. Our core message: Everyone has a part to play in reinventing the way the world works. And in the end, we attracted 8,647 super-empowered hopeful individuals to contribute their best ideas for the future to our superstructing experiment.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But before they tackled the superthreats, our players had an important first mission: invent their future selves.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Like any present-day social network, our 2019 social network asked you to fill out a personal profile. But our profile was different: it focused on <i class="calibre6">survivability</i> . What are the specific skills, resources, and communities you can bring to bear on these superthreats? What are you uniquely qualified to contribute to reinventing the world? We encouraged players to have fun imagining their future selves, but we also told them to keep it real. This was essential. <i class="calibre6">Don’t</i> invent a fictional character, we told them. This is about real play, not role play. We want to know who you <i class="calibre6">really</i> think you might be in 2019. Feel free to dream big, but make sure it’s grounded in reality.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Here’s the profile. How would you answer these questions? Remember: It’s not who you are today. It’s who you might be in the future.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">YOUR WORLD IN 2019</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">Where do you live? <br class="calibre2"/>Who do you live with? <br class="calibre2"/>What do you do? Where do you work? <br class="calibre2"/>What matters to you most?</div>
<div class="fmtx1">How did you get to be this person? Was there a particular turning point for you in the past ten years?</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx1"><b class="calibre5">YOUR UNIQUE STRENGTHS</b></div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx1">What do you know more about than most people? Tell us about your skills and abilities.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Who do you know? Tell us about the communities and groups you belong to, and what kinds of people are in your social and professional networks.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">This first mission helped immerse players in the future. It required them to vividly imagine the year 2019, and how their work and lives might be different by then. It also helped them identify specific personal resources they could bring to bear on the superthreats. At heart, Superstruct was about figuring out new roles for individuals, organizations, and communities to play in much bigger, longer-term efforts to make life on this planet better. To accomplish this goal, we had to help our players make direct connections between their current skills, resources, and abilities and the demands of the future.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">If you were to ask an ordinary person if they could personally fix the economy, stop a pandemic, or prevent famine, they probably wouldn’t even know where to begin. So we gave the players a specific place to start: in their own communities, groups, and social networks, using whatever they knew best as a foundation for suggesting solutions.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Finally, this mission gave us some concrete data about our players. We asked players to tell us, confidentially, a little bit about who they were in 2008, to help us put their forecasts and ideas into context. This 2008 data didn’t appear on their public profile; it was only to help during the research process, so we could cross-reference their future ideas by real-life age, location, and occupation. We wanted to find out more about how SEHIs think of themselves and what kinds of projects they are most likely to tackle.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So who superstructs? Here’s what we found out.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Out of just under nine thousand forecasters who joined the effort, the vast majority were between the ages of twenty and forty, with the rest spread out like a bell curve. Our youngest player was ten (he was particularly interested in the future of food, especially “lab-grown meat,” which is in fact an emerging food technology). Our oldest player was ninety (she was interested in the future of education).</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We had players from forty-nine out of fifty U.S. states and more than one hundred countries worldwide. We had a startlingly diverse group of professionals, including chief engineers, chief technical officers, chief creative officers; longshoremen, hotel concierges, and museum curators; astrophysicists, atmospheric scientists, mathematicians; nurses, plumbers, and photographers. There were also numerous college and graduate students, senior executives, members of the armed forces, and public servants.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">What expertise did these diverse participants bring to the game? Players identified expertise in areas as wide as labor activism, transportation and logistics, and robotics; specialty coffee, the comic book industry, the steel industry; immigration, forestry, and fashion; tourism, health care, and journalism ; chemical engineering, caregiving, and e-commerce; consulting, defense, and human resources; forensics, human rights, and nanotechnology.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en308" id="Ref-en308"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">26</sup><br class="calibre2"/>26</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">These were among the skills and resources we asked players to bring to bear on the five superthreats. And we asked them to tackle the superthreats in a very specific way: by inventing superstructures.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">HOW TO INVENT A SUPERSTRUCTURE</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">This is a game of survival, and we need you to survive.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">We’re facing superthreats, and we need to adapt.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">The existing structures of human civilization just aren’t enough. We need a new set of superstructures to rise above, to take humans to the next stage.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">You can help. Superstruct now. It’s your legacy to the human race.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx1"><b class="calibre5">Q: WHAT’S A SUPERSTRUCTURE?</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">A: A superstructure is a highly collaborative network that’s built on top of existing groups and organizations.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx1"><b class="calibre5">THERE ARE FOUR TRAITS THAT DEFINE A SUPERSTRUCTURE:</b> <div class="lsl">1. A superstructure brings together two or more different communities that don’t already work together.</div><div class="lsl">2. A superstructure is designed to help solve a big, complex problem that no single existing organization can solve alone.</div><div class="lsl">3. A superstructure harnesses the unique resources, skills, and activities of each of its subgroups. Everyone contributes something different, and together they create a solution.</div><div class="lsl">4. A superstructure is fundamentally new. It should sound like an idea that no one’s tried before.</div></div>
<div class="fmtx1"><b class="calibre5">Q: WHAT KINDS OF GROUPS CAN COME TOGETHER TO FORM SUPERSTRUCTURES?</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">A: Any kind of group at all. For profit and not-for-profit, professional and amateur, local and global, religious and secular, online and offline, fun and serious, big and small.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx1"><b class="calibre5">ANY EXISTING COMMUNITY CAN BE ADDED TO A SUPERSTRUCTURE ! HERE ARE SOME EXAMPLES:</b> <div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• Companies</div><div class="lsl">• Families</div><div class="lsl">• People who live in the same building or neighborhood</div><div class="lsl">• Industry and trade organizations</div><div class="lsl">• Nonprofits and NGOs</div><div class="lsl">• Annual conferences or festivals</div><div class="lsl">• Churches </div><div class="lsl">• Local or national governments</div><div class="lsl">• Online communities</div><div class="lsl">• Social network groups</div><div class="lsl">• Fan groups</div><div class="lsl">• Clubs</div><div class="lsl">• Teams</div></div></div>
<div class="fmtx1"><b class="calibre5">Q: HOW DO I CREATE A NEW SUPERSTRUCTURE?</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">A: Start by picking a community that you already belong to. What could your community uniquely contribute to solving one or more of the superthreats? And who else do you want to work with to make it happen?</div>
<div class="fmtx2">When you’re ready to share your idea, create a new wiki article. Use the wiki fields (name, motto, mission, who we need, how we work, and what we can accomplish) to describe your new superstructure.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx1"><b class="calibre5">Q: I’VE MADE A SUPERSTRUCTURE. WHAT NEXT?</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">A: When you have a basic description of your superstructure in place, invite other SEHIs and your own friends, colleagues, neighbors, and networks to join.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">If you’ve made your superstructure public, keep an eye on your wiki to welcome new members and to see how the superstructure evolves. If you’ve made your superstructure private, be sure to check back often to approve new members so they can help you build your superstructure.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Together, your Superstruct members can keep editing the wiki until it describes exactly the way you think your superstructure should work.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">DON’T STOP NOW!</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Once you’ve created your first superstructure, there’s lots more to do. You can create superstructures for other superthreats. Or you can design spin-off superstructures from your  original superstructure. You can invent competing superstructures, or bigger superstructures to swallow up superstructures that are already existing.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Keep superstructing, and surprise us with your big ideas!</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The most important rule for inventing a superstructure was that it should be unlike any existing organization. It should be a fundamentally new combination of people, skills, and scales of work. But it also had to be a plausible approach to a problem—a way to give people who don’t ordinarily work on challenges like hunger, pandemic, climate change, economic collapse, or network security a way to make a difference.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Inventing a superstructure was the core element of gameplay; it was how players earned survivability points (up to one hundred), which tallied into a total survivability score. The more thoughtful, clearly explained, creative, and surprising the superstructure, the more points a player earned. A player could also earn points by joining and contributing ideas to other players’ superstructures.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">What, exactly, is a survivability score? We described it to players as follows:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">Your Survivability Score is a number between 0 and 100 that appears in your Survival Profile. When you first join, you have a score of 0. Any score higher than 0 means you personally are becoming more and more important to the survival of the species. If you achieve a score of 100, you personally are absolutely central to the future of the human race.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In other words, our scoring system wasn’t meant to be competitive, but simply to represent your personal progress.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Let’s take a look at some brief descriptions of some of the particularly high-scoring superstructures, and the SEHIs who created them.</div>
<h2 class="h1"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">WE HAVE THE POWER—ENERGY - HARVESTING CLOTHES</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
我们有收集能量的衣服</h2>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx1">You don’t need to buy power from an energy company. You can make your own power. What you wear every day can help you collect and save energy, which you can use to power your laptop, your cell phone, your MP3 player, or to provide heat.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Think: Jackets with solar panels that collect energy and can be used to provide electric heat when you wear the jacket at night. Headbands with solar-paneled flowers that collect the energy you need to power your iPod. Fringed skirts that harness wind energy and store it in a tiny battery that you can detach and use to power anything at all. A belt with a sound wave collector that turns environmental noise into an energy source.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">We’re creating and collecting designs for all kinds of wearable energy sources. We’ll make working prototypes of these designs and present them in a We Have the Power fashion show. We need your help sharing and improving these designs so that as many people as possible can harvest their own energy.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The We Have the Power superstructure was founded by SEHI Solspire, or, in real life, Pauline Sameshima, an assistant professor in the department of teaching and learning at Washington State University. She led her design class in creating a series of real, working prototypes and impromptu campus fashion shows for clothes that incorporated the kinds of wearable energy technologies described above. Their SEHI mission: to use rapid prototyping and design innovation to tackle the Power Struggle superthreat, and help invent the future of energy.</div>
<h2 class="h1"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">SEEDS ATMS—WITHDRAW YOUR FOOD FOR FREE</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
SEEDS atm 种子自动取款机——免费提取食物</h2>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx1">Food shouldn’t cost anything. Seeds also shouldn’t cost anything.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">That’s why this superstructure has been created: to build a  Seeds ATM network, so anyone who needs seeds can easily go to an ATM and get free seeds.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">What we want to accomplish: spread the GYO (grow your own) food concept, as well as set the foundations of a bigger free-food network.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">We envision a network of secure Seeds ATMs installed at bank locations worldwide. However, as a working prototype, we propose a really simple hack: gumball machines. We will fill them with seeds and set them to not need money, or to simply require a penny. We will install them outside grocery stores and farmers’ markets.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">This superstructure was invented by SEHI Jorge Guberte, a twenty-five-year-old digital artist in São Paulo, Brazil. With no direct connection to the food industry or agriculture, he proposed a completely unexpected, extreme-scale solution to the Ravenous superthreat. His SEHI mission: to make access to food a basic civic right, and help invent the future of how we feed ourselves.</div>
<h2 class="h1"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">THE DEMOCRATIC CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC (DCAR)—THE REFUGEE STATE</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
中非民主共和国ー难民国</h2>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx1">DCAR, the Democratic Central African Republic, is a “weakly statelike entity,” or WSLE, a 16 million person quasi-state entity in east central Africa in a contested region where the neighboring countries have largely lost the will to continue fighting but will not allow each other to declare victory.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Humanitarian efforts in this disordered area therefore had to provide many basic functions of the state, such as identity services, issuing what amounted to passports, issuing a basic electronic currency, and generally trying to keep life going until somebody asserted governance over the area.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Eventually, after four or five years of interim governance using electronic democracy software and biometric cell phones, DCAR  has begun to have semiofficial, quasi-state status. Like Taiwan, it cannot safely assert full sovereignty, but the shells of the previous governments of the region have technically passed their legitimacy to the refugee councils of DCAR, and as long as nobody raises an army, nobody seems to mind self-organizing refugees trying to manage their lives until the governments settle their territorial disputes.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Anybody can support DCAR. You just have to remember how important it is that refugees get political rights to manage their own lives, just as we do. Being a refugee is hard enough without being oppressed too!</div>
<div class="fmtx2">If you want to get more involved, display the DCAR flag wherever you can to let people know that DCAR still matters.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The DCAR superstructure was founded by SEHI Hexayurt, or Vinay Gupta, a noted world expert on disaster relief. He is also the inventor of the Hexayurt, an inexpensive, lightweight shelter designed to provide sustainable housing for refugees. He wanted to address the Generation Exile superthreat in the context of the ongoing African refugee crisis. His SEHI mission: to help invent the future of peace and government.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">NONE OF THESE</b> ideas will reinvent the way the world works on its own. But alongside the more than five hundred other superstructures that players created, they effectively prove a new reality: that problem solving at extreme scales can involve ordinary people; that all scales of human organization can combine and recombine in startling ways; that continuous reinvention is not only possible, it’s an evolutionary imperative for the next decade.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">WE RAN SUPERSTRUCT</b> as a live forecasting experiment for six weeks. So what were the final results?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">After the game, our players inventoried and organized their efforts into a  catalog of solutions called the Whole Superstructure Catalog (a play on Stewart Brand’s <i class="calibre6">Whole Earth Catalog</i>), which you can view online, at Superstruct. <a href="http://wikia.com">wikia.com<br class="calibre2"/>维基百科网站</a>.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In addition to their catalog of 550 superstructures, our players created more than a thousand vivid first-person accounts of the superthreats, told in videos and photos, blogs and Twitter updates, Facebook messages and podcasts. This world lives online as a resource for other forecasters, policy makers, educators, and interested individuals to explore and analyze.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We set up traditional discussion forums to provide players with a sounding board for strategies they wanted to apply in their superstructures. The players held court across more than five hundred different forum topics, such as “Networking the offline world: How do we reach out to people who aren’t online?”; “What can we do with bicycles: Beyond exercise, how can we use bicycles to help solve some big problems?”; and “Art for art’s sake: What is the role of arts in 2019? What role can art play during times of epic crisis?” There’s enough reading material on these forums to comprise dozens of future-forecasting reports—and it’s all saved online for public browsing.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In terms of gameplay, we had nineteen players achieve a survivability score of 100—the equivalent of winning the staff of life in <i class="calibre6">Spore</i>, or creating a level 80 character in <i class="calibre6">World of Warcraft</i>. We invited these nineteen players to become our “SEHI 19,” and we extended invitations to them to continue collaborating with the Institute for the Future. All of the players, but in particular the SEHI 19, became a kind of superstructure for IFTF itself.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Finally, our Ten-Year Forecast team spent six months analyzing the results of the forecasting game. We prepared the year’s TYF research report, “Superstructing the Next Decade,” developing the themes explored in our scenario and analyzing the most promising superstructing methods demonstrated by our players. We’ve since made these materials—including a set of “Superstruct strategy cards,” a visual map of the Superstruct ecosystem, and three alternate scenarios for the next fifty years of planet craft—available to the public on the Institute for the Future’s website.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en309" id="Ref-en309"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">27</sup><br class="calibre2"/>27</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Oh, and just in case you’re wondering—how much good did our players collectively do, according to the game’s Global Extinction Awareness System?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">By the end of the six-week game, the players had pushed the survival horizon for the human species to the year 2086—or one year more for every thousand survivability points they collectively earned. That’s forty-four more years they earned us on this planet—enough time for two more generations of potential super-empowered hopeful individuals to be born and to start working on these problems with us.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The entire experience is perhaps best summed up by a Twitter post from one of our players. It epitomizes exactly what IFTF hoped to accomplish with the game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">“This is my favorite vision of the future, ever,” he wrote. “Because it’s the first one I feel personally capable of making a difference in.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Superstruct was designed to wake gamers up to the possibility of making the future together—a critical first step to increasing our collective engagement with global superthreats. But to produce real change in the world, it’s not enough to spread a feeling of super-empowerment and hope. We also have to build up actual world-changing capacity among gamers. We have to help them cultivate the specific future-making skills and abilities, and acquire the practical knowledge they need, in order to increase their chances of making a real and sustained difference.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Super-empowered hope and collaborative creativity must be combined with <i class="calibre6">practical learning</i> and <i class="calibre6">real capacity development</i>. And it can’t just happen in the parts of the world where computer and video game technology is already pervasive. World-changing games must be custom designed specifically for the most impoverished regions of the world, where future-making skills are most urgently needed—for example, developing areas in much of Africa.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">These are the two key insights that led me to my most recent game, EVOKE.</div>
<div class="calibre2"><a id="h2"><br class="calibre2"/></a></div>
<h1 class="h"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">EVOKE: A Crash Course in Changing the World</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
改变世界的速成班</h1>
<div class="fmtx">EVOKE is designed to empower young people all over the world, especially in Africa, to start actively tackling the world’s most urgent problems—poverty,  hunger, sustainable energy, clean-water access, natural disaster preparation, human rights.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Dubbed as a “crash course in changing the world” and produced for the World Bank Institute, the learning arm of the World Bank, EVOKE is a social network game designed to help players launch their own world-changing venture in just ten weeks. It’s playable on computers, but it’s optimized for mobile phones—the most ubiquitous social technology in Africa.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The world of EVOKE is set ten years in the future. The story, told in the form of a graphic novel, follows the adventures of a secret superhero network based in Africa. The network is made up of “stealth social innovators,” a concept we invented for the game.</div>
<div class="centeraligned"><img alt="014" class="imgepub1" src="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_014_r1.gif"/></div>
<div class="ctag"><b class="calibre5">Excerpt from episode eight of EVOKE.</b> <br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre6">(Jacob Glaser, World Bank Institute, 2010)</i></div>
<div class="fmtx3"><b class="calibre5">Social innovation</b>, of course, is a real concept—and an increasingly important method of tackling poverty worldwide. It means applying entrepreneurial ways of thinking and working to solve social problems that are ordinarily tackled by governments or by relief and aid agencies. The key principle of social innovation is that anyone, anywhere, can start their own project or business venture to try to solve a social problem. Also referred to as “social entrepreneurship,” it emphasizes taking risks, understanding the local context, and looking for breakthrough innovations, rather than applying standard, cookie-cutter solutions.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So what is <i class="calibre6">stealth</i> social innovation? In the world of EVOKE, social innovators tackle social problems with superheroic secrecy and spectacle—public  and yet mysterious, like Batman or Spider-Man—in order to capture global imagination so that the solutions have a real chance to catch on and spread virally. EVOKE superheroes are particularly known for applying an innovation method referred to by real development experts today as “African ingenuity.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Erik Hersman, a technologist and editor for the blog AfriGadget, is a leading proponent of African ingenuity. Hersman, who grew up in Sudan and now lives in Kenya, describes it as follows:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">A Malawian boy creates a windmill from old bicycle parts and sheet metal. A Kenyan man fabricates welding machines from scrap metal, wood and copper wire. An Ethiopian entrepreneur makes coffee machines from old mortar shells. A Malawian scientist invents a new micro-power plant that uses sugar and yeast. A South African youth makes a working paraglider from plastic bags, rope and bailing wire. Though you might not hear those stories in the international press, these are just a few of the incredible tales of African ingenuity happening every day in thousands of villages, godowns, industrial areas, roadside shops and homes throughout the continent. Africans are bending the little they have to their will, using creativity to overcome life’s challenges.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en310" id="Ref-en310"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">28</sup><br class="calibre2"/>28</a></div>
</div>

<div class="fmtx3">Many experts on Africa, including Hersman, believe that the people who tackle the hardest problems in the developing world today will be the ones most capable of solving any crisis, anywhere in the world, in the future. Indeed, problem solvers in Africa today may leapfrog past the rest of the world, coming up with cheaper, more efficient, and more sustainable solutions, simply because they have no other choice. The obstacles they face are so enormous, and the resources they have so limited, that their solutions <i class="calibre6">must</i> be more creative, more resourceful, and more resilient than traditional solutions developed by the rest of the world.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">EVOKE is designed to help players become a part of the emerging culture of African ingenuity—to build up their social innovation skills today so they have a real chance to become the world’s superheroes in the future.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So how does the gameplay work? Over the course of a ten-week “season,” players are challenged to complete a series of ten missions and ten quests. Each week’s challenges are focused around a new “urgent evoke.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">An <b class="calibre5">evoke</b>, in this game world, is an <i class="calibre6">urgent call to innovation</i>, an electronic SOS message sent from a city in crisis to the secret problem-solving network in Africa. In the first two episodes of the game, for example, the EVOKE network is called upon to help prevent a famine in Tokyo and to rebuild following a collapse of the energy infrastructure in Rio de Janeiro.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">After reading the urgent evoke online, players are challenged to respond in the real world—and get real, firsthand experience tackling an urgent crisis on a small and local scale. Consider the first two EVOKE missions.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">URGENT EVOKE: Food Security</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">More than a billion people go hungry every day. This week, YOU have the power to change at least one of those lives. Your objective : Increase the food security of at least one person in your community. Remember: Food security isn’t about providing temporary help or a single meal. It’s about long-term solutions to hunger and food shortages. Here are some ideas to get you started:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• Help someone start a home garden.</div><div class="lsl">• Volunteer at a local community garden.</div><div class="lsl">• Invent a way to make it easier for people in your community to share the food they have with others.</div><div class="lsl">• Create a resource for local farmers.</div></div></div>
<div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">URGENT EVOKE: Power Shift</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">Today, less than 10 percent of global electricity is produced by sustainable energy sources. This week, discover YOUR power to help change that number. Your objective: Design a new way to power something you use every day. Take a look around you. Something YOU use or do every day could be powered differently—with solar power, wind power, or kinetic power, for example. Maybe it’s  your mobile phone. Maybe it’s the light you use to read at night. Your solution should be cheaper or more sustainable than your current power source.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To help them brainstorm creative solutions to these challenging tasks, we provide players with secret “investigation files” that document social innovations already happening in Africa and other parts of the world—projects that can spark their own African ingenuity and inspire their own efforts.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In order to receive credit for their missions, players must share a blog post, video, or photo essay documenting the effort they made and what they learned. Other players review the mission evidence to verify it and to award EVOKE powers: plus-one spark, for example, or plus-one knowledge sharing, or plus-one local insight. Through the course of the game, by completing all ten missions, players build up a personal portfolio of world-changing efforts (their collection of blog posts, videos, and photos), as well as a profile of their unique future-making attributes (an interactive display of all the EVOKE powers they’ve earned).</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Meanwhile, players are also challenged to complete a series of ten online quests. These personal quests are designed to help players discover their own unique “origin story.” The game instructions explain, “In comic books, the origin story reveals how a character became a superhero—where their powers came from, who inspired them, and what events set them on a path to change the world. Before YOU can change the world, you need to figure out your superhero origins.” Over time the players’ quest log becomes a kind of world-changing calling card, describing, for example, their secret identity. The quest log would include answers to questions like “What are three things you know more about, or do better, than most of your friends and family?” and “What three personality traits or abilities make you stand out from the crowd?” The quest log also represents their heroic call to action when they answer questions like “If you had the power to convince today one person—or a hundred people, or a million people—to do one thing, who would it be, and what would you call on him or her to do?” By completing these introspective quests, players aren’t just learning about their own strengths or charting their own future.  They’re also developing the foundations for a multimedia business plan that they can use to attract collaborators, mentors, and investors.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Robert Hawkins, a senior education specialist at the World Bank Institute, first came up with the idea for a social innovation game. “The demand is so great for a game like this,” Hawkins told me when he first invited me to join the project as its creative director. “We keep hearing from African universities that they need better tools to engage students in real-world problems and to develop their capacities for creativity, innovation, and entrepreneurial action. This game needs to be a response to that desire, to serve as an engine for job creation now and in the future.” In fact, the game was promoted to university students across English-speaking Africa as “Free job training—for the job of inventing the future.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Not only are EVOKE players learning real-world skills, they’re also earning real-world honors and rewards. Players who successfully complete ten online missions in ten weeks receive a special résumé-worthy distinction: official certification as a World Bank Institute Social Innovator. Top players also earn postgame mentorships with experienced social innovators, and scholarships are awarded so they can share their vision for the future at the annual EVOKE Summit in Washington, D.C.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In the first trial of the game, run in the spring of 2010, we enrolled more than 19,000 young people from over 150 countries, including more than 2,500 students from sub-Saharan Africa—making it the largest collaborative online problem-solving community in Africa to date.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Collectively, in just ten weeks, this founding group of players completed more than 35,000 future-making missions together, documented on the EVOKE network. More importantly, as their final challenge, they proposed more than a hundred new social ventures—creative enterprises they planned to undertake in the real world, with the support of seed funding and ongoing mentorships from the World Bank Institute. These EVOKE-inspired ventures include:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• Evokation Station, a pilot program created and managed by high school students in Cape Town, South Africa, and designed to give  people the skills and knowledge to grow their own food for their families and as a source of income. The program is currently being tested in one of the poorest communities in Cape Town, Monwabisi Park, an informal settlement, or squatter camp, of more than twenty thousand displaced people who have been living for twelve years without running water, sanitation, proper houses, roads, or access to health care and employment.</div><div class="lsl">• Solar Boats, a project by and for young women in Jordan, with the goal of converting more than 120 glass boats in the Gulf of Aqaba to solar-powered ones, in order to save on fuel, decrease pollution of the Red Sea coral and sea life, and lead to cleaner beaches and lower-cost boating.</div><div class="lsl">• Spark Library, a venture developed by a U.S. graduate student in architecture, to design and pilot a new kind of crowdsourced library across sub-Saharan Africa. In order to check out a book from a Spark Library, you must first contribute a piece of local or personal knowledge, in order to help build up a database of indigenous or traditional knowledge about the environment, cultural practices, and natural resources.</div></div></div>
<div class="fmtx3">As I write this chapter, plans to develop future seasons of EVOKE are already under way, based on its early success. New seasons of the game will focus attention and engagement on a single issue, such as energy, food security, or women’s rights. Meanwhile, the first season of the game—EVOKE’s core curriculum—will be translated into Arabic for the Middle East, Spanish for Latin America, Mandarin for China, and more, in order to reach even more students. And in order to support EVOKE play in regions of Africa without reliable Internet access, episodes from the first season of EVOKE are being compiled into a single graphic novel, with all of the missions and quests adapted into workbook-style exercises. SMS-based interactivity—as most young people in the developing world do have access to mobile phones—will  ensure that these “pen and paper” players are still connected to the global EVOKE network.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The goal of all of these adaptations? To ensure, over time, that every young person on this planet receives an education in urgent problem solving and planet crafting—and has free and open access to a global network of potential world-changing collaborators, investors, and mentors.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">SO HOW MIGHT</b> future-making games like World Without Oil, Superstruct, and EVOKE evolve in a best-case-scenario future?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">At the end of Superstruct, all of the IFTF game masters had an opportunity to select and honor their favorite superstructure during an online streaming Superstruct Honors broadcast. I chose a superstructure called The Long Game, proposed by player Ubik2019, one of Superstruct’s most active players. The Long Game represents, to me, what future-making games must aspire to become by the end of the twenty-first century: an <i class="calibre6">epic collaboratory</i> for our most awe-inspiring global development efforts.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In real life, Ubik2019 is Gene Becker, formerly the worldwide director of product development for extreme performance and mobility at Hewlett-Packard, and now the founder and managing director of Lightning Laboratories, an emerging-technology consulting company that works with a range of Global 2000 companies and preinvestment start-ups. Becker brought to Superstruct a particularly keen sensibility about how to develop initiatives on a global scale, and how to leverage new network technologies for innovation. Here is Becker’s best idea for a new superstructure:</div>
<div class="calibre2"><a id="h3"><br class="calibre2"/></a></div>
<h1 class="h"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">THE LONG GAME</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
放长线钓大鱼</h1>
<div class="fmtx">Fostering a long-term mind-set by playing a game that lasts a thousand years.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx1"><i class="calibre6">Who we need:</i> SEHIs who believe that a long-term mind-set and a playful approach to life can help us to become a better people, make better choices about our actions and their consequences,  potentially avoid the kind of supercrises we are facing here in 2019, and give every person on the planet the opportunity to create a meaningful legacy to the human race.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx1"><i class="calibre6">What we can accomplish:</i> If you put just one dollar into an investment today that has an average real return of 3 percent per year after inflation and taxes, in a thousand years it would be worth $7 trillion. Now think about what your descendents thirty generations in the future might be able to do with such capital—and think about how you might communicate your wishes to them about how they would spend it.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx1">Now consider how we might invest our <i class="calibre6">nonfinancial</i> capital—intellectual, natural, social, familial, genetic—in such a way that it compounded its value over time. Such a rich gift we could endow for the future of humanity . . .<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en311" id="Ref-en311"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">29</sup><br class="calibre2"/>29</a></div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">A thousand-year game, combining financial and nonfinancial investment of our most important resources—how exactly would such a game work?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">During the Superstruct experiment, we brainstormed different ideas, focusing largely on structure rather than theme, story, or content. For example, we imagined the entire world setting aside one day each year to play the game, as a kind of global holiday. Of course, like all good games, participation would be optional. But the supergoal of the game would be, by the end of one thousand years, to engage virtually 100 percent of the human population in playing.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Enthusiastic players could spend as much time as they wanted throughout the year preparing for the global game day. Casual players could simply show up to a game site (online or in the real world) and take part for a few minutes, a few hours, or even all twenty-four hours in the year’s game day.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">That entire global game day would represent one “move” in the game. And perhaps, we imagined, The Long Game would be played in rounds of fifty moves each. So if you played The Long Game your entire life, you would hope to be able to experience a complete round at least once, if not twice.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Every tenth move would represent a bigger and more significant occasion, to provide a kind of momentous leveling-up occasion each decade. Each twenty-fifth and each fiftieth move, the halfway mark and the end of each round, would be an even more momentous occasion—each time the culmination of a quarter century of gamers’ efforts.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">What specifically would making a move in the game entail? We envisioned a combination of events. Social rituals and circle games to build common ground. Crowdsourced challenges and collective feats—in the style of a traditional barn raising—to focus the world’s energy and attention on a single problem and a single transformation. And forecasting exercises to create shared momentum for the future, and to collectively decide the challenges and themes of the next year’s set of games.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">No one would ever live to see both the start and the end of the game, of course—not even close. But the game would be a <i class="calibre6">throughline</i> for humanity, a tangible connection between our actions today and the world our descendants inherit tomorrow. It would create a sense of awe and wonder, inspiring us to imagine how this massively scaled adventure we are a part of could play out, and to make as meaningful an impact in the game as possible, so we can make a difference in our lifetime that lasts for many lifetimes more.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s not that hard to imagine people spending their entire lives playing a single game. Many <i class="calibre6">World of Warcraft</i> gamers have now been playing their favorite game for nearly an entire decade already; so has the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> community. Countless among us spend a lifetime mastering a game like chess, poker, or golf.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">And we already have a historical precedent for societies successfully keeping a game tradition alive for an entire millennium—the ancient Greeks ran their Olympiad every four years without interruption for roughly one thousand years.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The Long Game doesn’t exist yet. But it just might be what the world needs now.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Aspiring to engage every single human being on the planet in a single game isn’t an arbitrary goal. To accomplish that goal would mean transforming the planet and global society in key ways.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It would require every single village in the world to have some level of access to the Internet, via personal computers or mobile phones, so that truly everyone could contribute to the game. Universal Internet access is in its own right a significant and worthy goal. Today, roughly one in four people on the planet has reliable, daily Internet access.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en312" id="Ref-en312"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">30</sup><br class="calibre2"/>30</a> When every family in the remote villages of Africa, or in what today are the slums of India, or throughout Nicaragua—when they and everyone else in the world has access to The Long Game, that will mean greater access to education, culture, and economic opportunity as well.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Furthermore, for every person on the planet to play the same game, there would need to be free communications across all geopolitical borders. What would it take before every citizen of North Korea, for example, could play The Long Game?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The Long Game, if we have the will to design it, and if we create the means for universal participation, could be the good game that humanity plays to collectively take us to the next level, achieving a new scale of cooperation, coordination, and cocreation. As Kathi Vian urged in her introduction to the Superstruct Ten-Year Forecast:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">Zoom out. Look at the coming decade from the perspective of millennia of change. Focus on the progress of the universe from the breakthrough structures of the atom to the living cell, the biota, the community of nations, the global economy. This is how the future will be new, by continuing the incredible experiment of reorganization for greater complexity, by creating the next astonishing structural forms in this long evolutionary path.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It seems clear to me that games are the most likely candidate to serve as the next great breakthrough structure for life on earth.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">There’s no guarantee, of course, that evolution will continue along any given path, other than the path of improved survivability in a given environment. But all of the historic evidence seems to suggest that collaboration improves human survivability, and will continue to do so, as long as we can innovate new ways of working together.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">First humans invented language. Then farming, and cities; trade and democratic forms of government and the Internet—all ways of supporting human life and collaboration at bigger and more complex scales.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We have been playing good games for nearly as long as we have been human. It is now time to play them on extreme scales.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Together, we can tackle what may be the most worthwhile, most epic obstacle of all: a whole-planetary mission, to use games to raise global quality of life, to prepare ourselves for the future, and to sustain our earth for the next millennium and beyond.</div>
