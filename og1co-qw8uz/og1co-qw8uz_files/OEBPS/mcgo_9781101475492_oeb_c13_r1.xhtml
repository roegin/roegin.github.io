<div class="fmht"><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</b></div>
<div class="fmht"><b class="calibre5">Collaboration Superpowers</b></div>
<div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">B</b>y the age of twenty-one, the average young American has spent somewhere between two and three thousand hours reading books—and more than <i class="calibre6">ten thousand</i> hours playing computer and video games.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en271" id="Ref-en271"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">1</sup><br class="calibre2"/>1</a> With each year after 1980 you’re born, these statistics are increasingly likely to be true.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To put that number in perspective, ten thousand hours is almost exactly the same amount of time an average American student spends in the classroom from the moment they start fifth grade all the way through high school graduation—if they have perfect attendance. In other words, as much time as they spend learning reading, writing, math, science, history, government, geography, foreign languages, art, physical education, and so on over the course of their middle school and high school careers they spend teaching themselves (and each other) to play computer and video games. And unlike their formal education, which diffuses their attention across myriad different subjects and skills, every single gaming hour is concentrated on improving at just one thing: becoming a better gamer.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">With ten thousand hours under their belts by age twenty-one, most of these  young people will be more than just good gamers. They’ll be <i class="calibre6">exceptionally</i> good gamers.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">That’s because ten thousand hours of practice before the age of twenty-one, according to at least one theory, is the number one predictor of extraordinary success later in life.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Malcolm Gladwell first proposed the ten-thousand-hour theory in his best-selling book <i class="calibre6">Outliers: The Story of Success</i>. In <i class="calibre6">Outliers</i>, Gladwell reports on the life stories of high-achieving individuals, from violin virtuosos to all-star hockey players to Bill Gates, and he finds that they all have one autobiographical fact in common. By the age of twenty, the top performers in any given field had each accumulated at least ten thousand hours of practice at the one thing that eventually made them superstars. Meanwhile, the runnersup—the second tier of successful, but not extraordinarily successful, musicians, athletes, technologists, businesspeople, and so on—had on average eight thousand or fewer practice hours each.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Natural talent matters, of course, but not as much as practice and preparation. And, according to Gladwell, ten thousand hours of practice and preparation appears to be the crucial threshold, marking the difference between simply being good at something and becoming extraordinary at it.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">This means that we are well on our way to creating an <i class="calibre6">entire generation</i> of virtuoso gamers. Every young person who achieves ten thousand hours of gaming practice will be capable of extraordinary success in gaming environments later in life.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s potentially an unprecedented human resource: hundreds of millions of people worldwide who are going to be exceptionally good at the same thing—whatever it is games make us good at.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Which brings us to the million-dollar question for the future: What, exactly, are gamers getting good at?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">I’ve been researching that question for nearly a decade, first as a PhD student at the University of California at Berkeley and later as the director of game research and development at the Institute for the Future. Over the years, it has become increasingly clear to me that gamers—especially online gamers—are  exceptionally skilled at one important thing: collaboration. In fact, I believe online gamers are among the most collaborative people on earth.</div>
<div class="fmtx3"><b class="calibre5">Collaboration</b> is a special way of working together. It requires three distinct kinds of concerted effort: <i class="calibre6">cooperating</i> (acting purposefully toward a common goal), <i class="calibre6">coordinating</i> (synchronizing efforts and sharing resources), and <i class="calibre6">cocreating</i> (producing a novel outcome together). This third element, cocreation, is what sets collaboration apart from other collective efforts: it is a fundamentally <i class="calibre6">generative</i> act. Collaboration isn’t just about achieving a goal or joining forces; it’s about creating something together that it would be impossible to create alone.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">You can collaborate to create just about anything: a group experience, a knowledge resource, a work of art. Increasingly, gamers are collaborating to create all of these outcomes. In fact, they’re collaborating even when they’re competing against each other to win. More and more, gamers are collaborating even when they’re playing alone.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It seems counterintuitive: how can you collaborate with someone when you’re actively opposing them? Or even harder to imagine: how on earth can you collaborate all by yourself? But in fact, online gamers are increasingly doing both, thanks to two factors: the fundamentally collaborative aspects of playing any good game, and new game technologies and design patterns that support entirely new ways of working together.</div>
<div class="calibre2"><a id="h1"><br class="calibre2"/></a></div>
<h1 class="h"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">The Evolution of Games as a Collaboration Platform</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
游戏作为协作平台的演变</h1>
<div class="fmtx">Since ancient times, gaming with others has always required making a concerted effort to collaborate. This is true of dice games, card games, chess, sports, and any other kind of multiplayer game you can think of.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Every multiplayer game begins with a cooperative agreement. Gamers agree to play by the same rules and to value the same goal. This establishes a <b class="calibre5">common ground</b> for working together.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Games also require us to coordinate attention and participation resources. Gamers must show up at the same time, in the same mind-set, to play together. They actively focus their attention on the game, and they agree to ignore everything else for as long as they’re playing. They practice <b class="calibre5">shared concentration</b> and <b class="calibre5">synchronized engagement.</b></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Gamers depend on each other to play as hard as they can, because it’s no fun winning without a challenge. In this way, gamers foster <b class="calibre5">mutual regard</b><i class="calibre6">.</i> Out of respect for each other, they put in their best effort, and they fully expect to encounter a worthy partner or adversary.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Gamers rely on each other at all times to keep the game going, even if it’s not working out in their favor. Whenever they see a game through to completion, gamers are honing their ability to honor a <b class="calibre5">collective commitment.</b></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Perhaps most importantly, gamers actively work together to make believe that the game truly matters. They conspire to give the game real meaning, to help each other get emotionally caught up in the act of playing, and to reap the positive rewards of playing a good game. Whether they win or lose, they’re creating <b class="calibre5">reciprocal rewards.</b></div>
<div class="fmtx3">In short, good games don’t just happen. Gamers work to make them happen. Any time you play a game with someone else, unless you’re just trying to spoil the experience, you are actively engaged in highly coordinated, <i class="calibre6">prosocial</i> behavior. No one forces gamers to play by the rules, to concentrate deeply, to try their best, to stay in the game, or to act as if they care about the outcome. They do it voluntarily, for the mutual benefit of everyone playing, because it makes a better game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">This is true even in games that involve fierce competition. Consider the origins of the English word “compete”: it comes from the Latin verb <i class="calibre6">competere</i>, which means “to come together, to strive together” (from <i class="calibre6">com-</i>, or “with,” and <i class="calibre6">-petere</i>, meaning “to strive, seek”). To compete <i class="calibre6">against</i> someone still requires coming together <i class="calibre6">with them</i>: to strive toward the same goal, to push each other to do better, and to participate wholeheartedly in seeing the competition through to completion.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">That’s why today competitive online gamers—even after they’ve been virtually  beaten, bloodied, or blasted by each other—thank each other afterward by typing or saying “GG,” short for “good game.” It’s a grateful acknowledgment that, regardless of who wins or loses, everyone in a good game has tried hard, played fair, and worked together. That’s the fundamental act of collaboration at the heart of every good multiplayer game: the active and concerted creation of a positive experience. Gamers don’t just play a good game. They <i class="calibre6">make</i> a good game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In fact, the ability to make a good game together has recently been identified by researchers as a distinctive human capability—indeed, perhaps <i class="calibre6">the</i> distinctive human capability. The developmental psychologist Michael Tomasello, author of <i class="calibre6">Why We Cooperate</i> and codirector of the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, has spent his career devising experiments to investigate what kinds of behaviors and skills set humans apart from other species. His research suggests that the ability to play complex games together, and to help others learn the rules of a game, represents the essence of what makes us human—something he calls “shared intentionality.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en272" id="Ref-en272"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">2</sup><br class="calibre2"/>2</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Shared intentionality, according to Tomasello, is defined as “the ability to participate with others in collaborative activities with shared goals and intentions.” <a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en273" id="Ref-en273"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">3</sup><br class="calibre2"/>3</a> When we have shared intentionality, we actively identify as part of a group, we deliberately and explicitly agree on a goal, and we can understand what others expect us to do in order to work toward the goal. Tomasello’s research reveals that, in comparison with humans, other intelligent social species like chimpanzees simply do not appear to have shared intentionality. They don’t have the natural instinct and ability to focus their attention on the same object, coordinate group activity, assess and reinforce each other’s commitment to the activity, and work toward a common goal.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Without the distinctly human capacity for shared intentionality, we couldn’t collaborate; we would have no idea how to build common ground, set group goals, or take collective action. According to Tomasello, children are capable of shared intentionality at a very early age. His evidence: their natural ability to play a game with others, and their ability to recognize when someone isn’t playing the game in a way that favors the group.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In one of Tomasello’s key experiments at the Max Planck Institute, children between the ages of two and three are taught to play a new game together—either a dice game for the two-year-olds or a building-block game for the three-year-olds. <a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en274" id="Ref-en274"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">4</sup><br class="calibre2"/>4</a> Then a puppet controlled by another experimenter joins the game and plays it incorrectly, according to its own made-up rules. Tomasello and his colleagues report that children immediately and universally object to this bad game behavior and attempt to correct the puppet, in order to keep the game successfully going—even though they haven’t been instructed to do so. This behavior was more “vociferous” among the three-year-olds, according to the published findings, but clearly widespread among the two-year-olds as well. We are able to make a good game together—and we are inclined to do so from nearly the moment we are born. We have a hardwired desire and capacity to cooperate and coordinate our actions with others, to effectively immerse ourselves in groups, and to actively cocreate positive shared experiences.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">And yet this desire can be diminished and our natural abilities weakened or eventually lost, Michael Tomasello argues, if we grow up in a culture without sufficient opportunities to nurture and develop it.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">If we are to achieve our human potential to be extraordinary collaborators, he urges, we must immerse ourselves in high-collaboration environments—and we must encourage young people to spend as much time as possible participating in groups that encourage and value cooperation. Fortunately, as online and multiplayer games become more and more central to global popular culture, we have all the encouragement we need to practice our natural collaboration abilities. Multiplayer and online games strengthen our capacity to build and exercise shared intentionality.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Every time we agree to play a game together, we are practicing one of the talents that makes us fundamentally human.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">THIS IS NOT</b> to suggest that online gaming today is one giant cooperative utopia. The kill-or-be-killed adrenaline rush of player vs. player environments can easily overshadow the very real undertones of cooperation and collaboration that otherwise exist. Graphic violent content, combined with the anonymity of  the Internet, doesn’t necessarily inspire camaraderie among strangers. That’s why toxic social interactions can and do erupt in hard-core, or especially competitive, communities, as normally playful gamer behaviors like taunting and trash-talking get out of hand.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Even in friendlier matches, many gamers care very deeply about whether or not they win. They’re seeking that fiero moment and wind up feeling disappointed or angry if they lose. In that case, even the fundamentally collaborative spirit of making a good game together can’t completely alleviate the sting of loss.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Yet despite all these potentially mitigating factors, gamer culture is moving insistently in the direction of more shared intentionality, not less. For the past few years, cooperative, or <i class="calibre6">co-op</i>, play and <i class="calibre6">collaborative creation</i> systems have consistently remained the most celebrated trends in gaming.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In <b class="calibre5">co-op mode,</b> gamers work together to defeat an AI opponent and to increase each other’s scores, rather than competing against each other. Classic examples of co-op play include <i class="calibre6">Rock Band</i> and the first-person shooter series <i class="calibre6">Left 4 Dead</i>. Although there are competitive elements to both games, the primary focus is on working together to achieve a goal.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Even in game series that have previously specialized in single-player and player vs. player experiences, co-op mode is becoming more and more central. The counterterrorist-themed <i class="calibre6">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</i>, the fastest-selling entertainment product in world history—it grossed $550 million in five days, more than any book, movie, album, or other game ever produced—has been particularly praised for its new Spec Ops mode, a series of twenty-three extremely challenging missions designed to be played cooperatively with a friend.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The industry’s increased attention to co-op mode represents an extremely significant development in gaming culture. It’s a recognition that many gamers are happier tackling challenges together than taking on each other as opponents. Co-op games deliver all the emotional rewards of a good game, while helping gamers avoid activating the negative emotions that can come with highly competitive play: feelings of aggression, anger, disappointment, or humiliation. That’s why it’s not surprising that surveys and polls repeatedly  have shown that, on average, three out of four gamers prefer co-op mode to competitive multiplayer.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en275" id="Ref-en275"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">5</sup><br class="calibre2"/>5</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Game developers aren’t just designing more co-op play; they’re also creating new <b class="calibre5">real-time coordination tools</b> to help us find the right people at the right time to cooperate with. The Xbox Live platform, for example, enables players to monitor who else in their social network is logged in to the game console, what they’re playing at the moment, and what other games they have in their library to play with you. You can browse your friends’ records of game achievements and compare them against your own—which helps you figure out who would make a good partner on a given mission or in a particular game. You can also receive alerts on your mobile phone or your computer whenever, for example, a friend logs in to Xbox Live to play a game or he or she unlocks an achievement. As a result, Xbox gamers have an unusually high level of awareness of what potential coplayers are doing at any given time, what they’re good at, and what resources they have to play with. The ambient awareness dramatically amplifies their ability to coordinate good gameplay.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Meanwhile, in <b class="calibre5">collaborative creation systems</b>, gamers get to create their own digital content, in order to build up their favorite worlds for the benefit of other players. Take <i class="calibre6">Little Big Planet</i> for example—it’s one of the most acclaimed collaborative creation games released in recent years. In the traditional “play mode” of the game, you cooperate with up to three friends to traverse the game world and collect game objects together—stickers, gadgets, toys, and craft and building materials. At any time, you can switch from play mode to “create mode”; here you find yourself in a collaborative building environment called Popit, in which you can design your own original action-adventure landscapes out of the objects and materials you’ve already collected. It’s a level-building system that you might call the game-design equivalent of Google Docs. Multiple people can view and edit the level at the same time; it can then be shared, or “published,” to the rest of the world.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Within a year, more than 1.3 million player-created levels had been published by <i class="calibre6">LBP</i> players. Compare this epic number with the relatively small number of official <i class="calibre6">LBP</i> levels: forty-five. Collectively, the <i class="calibre6">LBP</i> player base has dramatically expanded the playable <i class="calibre6">LBP</i> universe by a factor of nearly thirty  thousand. As one games journalist observed on the one-year anniversary of the game’s release, “[It] would likely take multiple lifetimes to play through every single creation out there.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en276" id="Ref-en276"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">6</sup><br class="calibre2"/>6</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">The ability to create your own levels and share them with other players was the signature selling feature of <i class="calibre6">Little Big Planet</i>. But increasingly, successful game series are offering similar systems as a “value-add,” in order to give players more explicit collaboration opportunities. For example, <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i> introduced the new Forge system, which invites players to design their own original multiplayer <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> levels, or “maps,” by customizing what weapons, vehicles, and tools are distributed where. Like LBP’s Popit system, players can upload and share their custom configurations with each other, and using the Forge tools, it’s possible to create literally billions and billions of different maps. So instead of being restricted to a finite number of play environments, the <i class="calibre6">Halo</i> community can keep the game going, increasing and diversifying the playing challenges for each other indefinitely.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s not easy to design a good world, of course. So alongside the growing collection of collaborative creation systems, there are also a growing number of player-created guides to creating better levels and maps. Take, for example, the Forge Hub, a resource for becoming a better <i class="calibre6">Halo 3</i> world builder. It offers extensive tutorials in various mapmaking skills and curates player-created maps into different collections. It’s a natural extension of the knowledge sharing and collective intelligence culture already taking place on the more than ten thousand player-created game wikis. Gamers aren’t just making each other better players; they’re making each other better designers.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But perhaps the most unusual innovation in gamer collaboration culture in recent years is the notion of the <b class="calibre5">massively single-player online game.</b> It’s a twist on the traditional massively multiplayer online concept—and, on first impression, it sounds like an impossible paradox. How can you have a “massively” single-player experience when by definition a single-player experience occurs alone?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The inventor of the term is Will Wright, the famed creator of <i class="calibre6">SimCity</i> and <i class="calibre6">The Sims</i> games. He coined it to describe his 2008 game <i class="calibre6">Spore</i>, a simulation  of the universe that invites players to design a galaxy from scratch, starting with a single-cell creature and evolving it up into a land-dwelling species, then into tribes, complex civilizations, and ultimately a space-faring, planet-designing megacivilization.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">All <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> gameplay is single-player: an individual controls all the simulation details and conducts all the fighting, mating, crafting, and exploring alone. There are no other players in the simulated ecosystem; everything in the world is controlled by artificial intelligence. So what makes it <i class="calibre6">massively</i> single-player, as opposed to simply single-player? A very large percentage of the content in each player’s game world—the other creatures you encounter and the civilizations you visit—has been created by other players who have contributed them to the online Sporepedia, a massive database of ecosystem content. When you play <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> online, your computer checks the Sporepedia for new and interesting content and downloads it into your personal Spore ecosystem, making your game world a mix of your own original contributions and those of many, many others.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Although there is no direct interaction with other players, you indirectly collaborate with each other to invent the <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> universe. You can randomly populate your world with other players’ creations, or you can handpick creations you like from the Sporepedia. You can even subscribe to a Sporecast, which will automatically update your game world with new content created by your friends or favorite players.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Players use Sporepedia and the <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> forums and wikis to learn what other players are making and to improve their own creation techniques. They don’t collaborate in the real-time gameplay, but ultimately the world that players help design is a collaborative product: a unique combination of each player’s own creations mingled with content from hundreds, thousands, or even millions of other players, depending on how far they get in the game and how much content they choose to download.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">A massively single-player game like <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> suggests that epic contexts combined with collaborative production tools and sophisticated content-sharing platforms can create opportunities for what we might call <b class="calibre5">lightweight, asynchronous  collaboration</b>. It’s less immediately interactive, but it can still produce extreme-scale results. So far, <i class="calibre6">Spore</i> players from more than thirty countries have created and shared more than 144 million ecosystem objects, from creatures to buildings to space-faring vehicles.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">OF COURSE ,</b> collaboration skills are on the rise around the world among nongamers as well. From widespread basic Internet literacy and mobile technology smarts to rapidly expanding Web 2.0 and crowdsourcing know-how, people everywhere are becoming increasingly connected and improving their ability to cooperate, coordinate, and create together in many important ways. In this sense, gamers are just part of a larger social and technological trend toward more collaboration.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But gamers are having so much <i class="calibre6">fun</i> developing their collaboration skills, they’re collectively spending more time than anyone else in the world honing and applying them. Every day and night, hundreds of millions of strangers from all over the world come together to prototype and playtest new ways of collaborating. The more they play together, and the closer they get to ten thousand hours of practice collaborating, the more justifiably optimistic they become about what they can accomplish together—and so they demand even more extreme collaboration challenges. And because gamers have developed such a growing appetite for collaboration at extreme scales, they’ve pushed the gaming industry to develop software and platforms that increasingly emphasize collaboration as a central gameplay mechanism.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As a result of the industry’s relentless focus on innovating new ways to cooperate, coordinate, and cocreate, many online gamers are developing a new set of <i class="calibre6">collaboration superpowers</i> that transcend what they—and nongamers—are capable of doing in real-world, or nongame, environments. These gamers are on the front lines of testing and improving the ways we organize ourselves, amplify each other’s individual abilities, and contribute to the common good.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Which gives us another fix for reality: <div class="afmtx1"><div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">FIX # 13: TEN THOUSAND HOURS COLLABORATING</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">Compared with games, reality is disorganized and divided. Games help us make a more concerted effort—and over time, they give us collaboration superpowers.</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">What do I mean by collaboration <i class="calibre6">superpowers</i>?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">A superpower is not just a new skill. It’s a skill that so far surpasses any previously demonstrated skill, and it effectively changes our notion of what is humanly possible.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The term “superpower” suggests that something is happening outside the traditional model of learning and skill acquisition. Typically, we think of practice as moving us from a zero-skill level to basic competency and then, if we keep practicing, to proficiency and ultimately to mastery. But mastery presumes that there is some finite end to the skill level it is possible to achieve. So why stop at mastery? The term “superpower” reminds us that we are on the threshold of a new kind of capability, one that has not yet been mastered by anyone, anywhere. There’s no telling yet how far these new capabilities will develop.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">What, exactly, do these new capabilities look like?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In my research at the Institute for the Future, I’ve developed a model of how someone with collaboration superpowers works. It involves three key new skills and abilities.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Extraordinary collaborators are extremely extroverted or outgoing in a network environment—even if they’re introverted or shy in face-to-face settings. They have what I call a <b class="calibre5">high ping quotient</b>, or high PQ. (In tech speak, a “ping” is a computer network tool that sends a message from one computer to another in order to check whether it is reachable and active. If it is, it will send back the message “pong,” thus establishing an active line of communication.) Extraordinary collaborators have no qualms about <i class="calibre6">pinging</i>—or reaching out via electronic means—to others to ask for their participation. They’re also  highly likely to pong back when other people ping them. That’s what makes a high ping quotient a form of social capital.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Of course, it helps to have a good sensibility about who to ping when. (Otherwise, you become a participation spammer.) That’s why extraordinary collaborators develop a kind of internal <b class="calibre5">collaboration radar</b>, or sixth sense, about who would make the best collaborators on a particular task or mission. This sixth sense comes from building up a very strong social network and maintaining a kind of peripheral awareness of what other people are doing, where they are, and what they’re getting good at. And it’s not just an internal system: collaboration radar is often augmented with “ambient information systems,” like Twitter lists, the Xbox 360 friends dashboard, or the Groundcrew volunteer availability system. The stronger your collaboration radar, the faster you can leverage individuals’ abilities toward the right effort.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Finally, the most extraordinary collaborators in the world exercise a superpower I call <b class="calibre5">emergensight</b>. It’s the ability to thrive in a chaotic collaborative environment. The bigger and more distributed a collaborative effort gets, the more likely it is to become both chaotic and hard to predict. We know this from physics and systems theory: bigger isn’t more; it’s different. That’s the principle of <i class="calibre6">emergence</i>. It’s impossible to predict what will happen at scale until you get there, and it’s likely to be vastly more complex than you expected. Of course, with increased complexity comes increased potential for chaos.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Extraordinary collaborators are adept and comfortable working within complex, chaotic systems. They don’t mind messiness or uncertainty. They immerse themselves in the flow of the work and keep a high-level perspective rather than getting lost in the weeds. They have the information stamina to filter large amounts of noise and remain focused on signals that are meaningful to their work. And they practice possibility scanning: always remaining open and alert to unplanned opportunities and surprising insights—especially at bigger scales. They are willing to bypass or throw out old goals if a more achievable or a more epic goal presents itself. And they are constantly zooming out to construct a much bigger picture: finding ways to extend collaborative efforts to new communities, over longer time cycles and toward more epic goals.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">These three ways of working make up what I consider to be the most important attributes of an extraordinary collaborator. Together, these traits enable us to discover and contribute our individual strengths and expertise to a large, open-ended effort.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">These collaboration superpowers aren’t widely distributed yet. They’re concentrated among gamers who, for the past decade, have consistently played the games that have been on the leading edge of co-op, collective intelligence, and collaborative production. But, obviously, these collaboration superpowers would be extremely useful outside of game settings. They could be applied to tremendous effect across many different real-world domains: data collection and analysis, social action, risk assessment, scientific research, innovation of new products and services, and government, to name just a few.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Indeed, if these collaboration superpowers become sufficiently widespread, it’s easy to imagine a future in which there is significantly more collective effort harnessed toward solving extreme-scale problems, like ending poverty, preventing catastrophic climate change, reducing terrorist activity, and improving global health. But before we can use these superpowers to solve real-world problems, we need to distribute them more broadly throughout society. Collaboration is most effective when there are diverse actors. We need to put these collaboration superpowers in the hands of as many people as possible—especially young people, who represent the next generation of social actors and problem solvers.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">That’s why, in my commercial game-design work, I am always drawn to projects that can serve as learning environments for collaboration superpowers. I think of these projects as global collaboration laboratories, or <b class="calibre5">collaboratories</b> : online spaces for young people from around the world to come together and test and develop their ability to cooperate, coordinate, and cocreate at epic scales.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The best way to understand the modus operandi of extraordinary collaborators is in the context of a real working collaboratory. So let’s take a look at The Lost Ring, an alternate reality game that I designed for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.</div>

失落的戒指——一个实践新超能力的实验室</h2>
<div class="fmtx"><i class="calibre6">The Olympic Games are broken.</i> That’s what I thought to myself in the summer of 2007 when I was first invited to direct an alternate reality game for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">For 99.99 percent of the world, I thought to myself, the Olympics are all spectacle, a vicarious thrill at best. There’s no real participation. No active engagement. We watch the games, but we don’t actually get to play.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It wasn’t supposed to be that way. The Olympic mission, after all, is to bring the world together through play. The Olympics are also meant to create global community. But even the biggest Olympic fans have virtually no interaction with other people from around the world during the games. We’re not physically at the Olympic Village, where the many elite athletes congregate. Instead, we’re at home watching the games on television. How can we expect to bring the world together through the Olympic Games if 99.99 percent of the world doesn’t get to actually play?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">This wouldn’t have bothered me that much if I didn’t actually believe in the Olympic mission. The modern Olympics are the best-known and longest-lasting effort to use games as a platform for establishing common ground, focusing global attention, fostering mutual regard, and creating global community. I couldn’t imagine a better context than the Olympics for trying to build a global collaboratory.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">That’s when it occurred to me: could the Olympic tradition of bringing the world together for an intense period of play be extended from athletes to <i class="calibre6">gamers</i>?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">If so, it would represent an ideal opportunity to give the growing generation of virtuoso gamers a chance to demonstrate their extraordinary talents to the world. Just like the world’s greatest athletes, our best global gamers could show us collaborative feats previously unthinkable. They could inspire us all to push the limits of our own collaboration powers.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So, as early anticipation for the Olympics mounted a year in advance of the 2008 Beijing games, I accepted an invitation from McDonald’s, a global  Olympic sponsor, and the International Olympic Committee to join the efforts of a leading digital creative agency in San Francisco, AKQA. Our shared objective was to create an online game that would give young adults around the world an opportunity to collaborate at a scale as awe-inspiring as the modern Olympic Games themselves. Together, we spent an entire year working with a creative development team of more than fifty people to help computer and video gamers turn the 2008 Summer Olympics into a game that <i class="calibre6">they</i> could play, a collaborative effort that <i class="calibre6">they</i> could undertake.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">This is the story of The Lost Ring and how it reinvented the reality of the Olympic Games.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="fmtx1"><i class="calibre6">Most of you listening to this podcast will not believe the story I am about to tell you. How is it possible, you will ask, that the greatest sport of all time has been forgotten for almost 2,000 years? I’m Eli Hunt, and this is the legend of the Lost Sport of Olympia.</i></div>

<div class="fmtx1">—from an invitation to a Lost Sport of Olympia training event held in San Francisco, April 15, 2008</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">On February 24, 2008, a fictional character by the name of Eli Hunt launched a real podcast series called Secrets of the Ancient Games. The series was promoted by the International Olympic Committee on the home page of its highly trafficked website with the tag line “Investigate Olympic mysteries and learn about the history of the earliest games!” Visitors to Hunt’s site discovered that the podcast series focused on the so-called Lost Sport of Olympia—a blindfold game that Hunt, an amateur archaeologist, believed the ancient Greeks had mysteriously banned from their Olympics before attempting to destroy all evidence that the game had ever existed.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Was the story of the Lost Sport of Olympia just an ancient urban legend? To prove otherwise, Hunt presented three compelling pieces of evidence: an  ancient Greek pottery shard that depicted naked blindfolded runners; a defaced stone tablet dated to 530 BC and inscribed with training instructions for an Olympic sport requiring an odd combination of athletic skills—“trust, endurance, spatial memory, and orienteering”; and a twenty-one-hundred-year-old victory plaque for an ancient Olympic champion named Demetros—a name historians had never seen referenced on any other surviving Olympic artifacts. Even more mysteriously, the victory plaque called the unknown Olympian the “champion of <i class="calibre6">la paigna megas</i>”—the most important game.</div>
<div class="centeraligned"><img alt="011" class="imgepub1" src="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_011_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="ctag"><b class="calibre5">Artist’s illustration of the fictional “Pyron’s shard,” which in the story of The Lost Ring dates to 740 BC and is said to have depicted blindfolded Olympic athletes.</b></div>
<div class="ctag"><i class="calibre6">(AKQA, 2008)</i></div>
<div class="fmtx3">If the blindfold game really was the most important ancient Olympic event, then why had historians never heard of it before? Hunt left his viewers with the following challenge:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">Was there really ever a lost sport? If so, how was it played? And why was it considered the most important of all ancient games? If the lost sport indeed existed, we can only assume that the ancient  Greeks themselves conspired to hide it from the rest of the world. But what would make them go to such lengths to conceal it? Even with my new research, it is difficult to accept that everything we think we know about the ancient Olympics may be wrong. But if I am right, and if the Greeks did hide the truth, then perhaps there are more clues out there for those of us who look closely enough . . .</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Within twenty-four hours, a community of online gamers and bloggers caught wind of the lost-sport mystery and immediately took Hunt up on his challenge. They didn’t necessarily believe his evidence—but they could sense that some kind of interesting game was afoot. And because Hunt subtitled his podcasts in seven different languages—English, French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, and Mandarin—these gamers were from all over the world. Using a variety of translation tools to talk to each other, the gamers created a discussion forum, set up a chat room, assembled a wiki, and started e-mailing Hunt for more information. They were determined to get to the bottom of the mystery of the Lost Sport of Olympia.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The gamers followed a trail of clues from Hunt’s online podcast to other blogs and websites, which created a vast web of real historical information and urban legend, and then finally to the real world, where over the span of just six short weeks they discovered twenty-seven physical artifacts: pages of a mysterious illustrated text called the Lost Ring Codex. Each page contained more information about the rules and the purpose of the lost sport. These pages, dated to 1920, were scattered across twenty-seven countries on five continents. The text was written in the universal language Esperanto and apparently had been created and hidden by an earlier generation of lost-sport investigators who had ultimately failed in their efforts to revive the ancient game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">How did they find these hidden artifacts? First they learned a real ancient Greek navigational shorthand known as “omphalos code,” the subject of Eli Hunt’s second podcast. Next, they worked together on a wiki to translate a set of twenty-seven omphalos codes into modern-day GPS coordinates. Then they called in favors from members of <i class="calibre6">their</i> social networks, who called in favors from members of their social networks, to find people willing to recover the  pages of the codex in these far-flung real-world locations, from a bookstore in Johannesburg to a hostel in Rio de Janeiro to an art gallery in Bangalore.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As each page was recovered, players volunteered to translate them out of Esperanto into eight different languages—the game’s original seven, plus Dutch, since a sizable contingent of players had formed in the Netherlands—and the gamers were thus able to create a new and complete record of the Lost Sport of Olympia for people all over the world.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The translated codex revealed, among other things, that the ancient game was officially called The Human Labyrinth, but nicknamed The Lost Ring. Piece by piece, players learned that it was a team sport for sixteen players: one blindfolded runner and fifteen “wall members.” The wall members used their bodies to create a human-size labyrinth by standing on string laid out in the shape of an ancient Cretan maze. The runner, unable to see or feel his or her way, would try to escape from the center of the labyrinth as fast as possible, while the wall members hummed to help guide the runner. The official maze dimensions ensured that the teams never had enough members to cover the entire wall at any given time; instead, they would have to race ahead of the runner to create more wall before the runner reached that part of the labyrinth. Each labyrinth team competed against other labyrinth teams to get their runner out the fastest.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So what did the gamers do once they had solved the mystery of the ancient Olympic event? They did what any true gamers would do: they started to play it. And they committed to bringing back the lost sport in time for the real 2008 Summer Olympics. Teams formed across the world: in Singapore, Tokyo, Bangkok, and Shanghai; in London, Paris, Zurich, and Vienna; in San Francisco, Portland, New York, and Dallas; in Buenos Aires and São Paolo; in Johannesburg and in Cape Town; in Sydney, Melbourne, and Wellington.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Every weekend for several months, gamers gathered in different cities to revive the Lost Sport of Olympia and master the blindfolded labyrinth race. They uploaded hundreds of training videos to YouTube and added thousand of training photos to Flickr in order to show off how good they were getting, to teach other people how to play, and to trade strategies with other lost-sport athletes.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The teams got faster and faster as they developed better teamwork and tried out more and more complex strategies. Soon, each weekend a new world record was being set somewhere—Vienna this week, New York City another, Shanghai the next. The U.S. Olympic champion runner Edwin Moses volunteered to serve as the online virtual coach of the lost-sport athletes, sending weekly advice by e-mail and in online chats. Collectively, the lost-sport athletes worldwide egged each other on, improving their best times from an average of three minutes and thirty seconds per race when they started training to an average of fifty-nine seconds per race by summer’s end, with a world’s best of thirty-eight seconds.</div>

<div class="ctag"><b class="calibre5">A New Zealand lost-sport team posts a training video online.</b> <br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre6">(Still from video by Joshua Judkins, 2008)</i></div>
<div class="fmtx3">On August 24, 2008, the closing day of the 2008 Summer Olympic Games, six months after Eli Hunt had uploaded his first podcast, one hundred of the world’s best computer gamers put their lost-sport knowledge to the test. The  six best human labyrinth teams in the world assembled in Beijing, San Francisco, Salvador da Bahia, London, Tokyo, and Wellington to compete in their own self-organized world championships. As the final medal counts were tallied for the real Olympic Games, these gamers-turned-athletes competed against each other for honorary gold (Tokyo), silver (San Francisco), and bronze (Wellington) medals in the Lost-Sport Olympics.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Those are just some of the highlights of The Lost Ring, an alternate reality game that took a full year to develop and another six months to play, eventually creating a player community made up of citizens from more than one hundred countries on six continents: 28 percent from North America, 25 percent from Europe, 18 percent from the Asia-Pacific region, 13 percent from Latin America, 9 percent from Oceania, and smaller clusters in areas such as Dubai, Israel, and South Africa. More than a quarter of a million gamers participated, and the most active participants—the core team of puzzle solvers, translators, social engineers, researchers, and athletes—numbered above ten thousand—just as many members as the community of official 2008 Olympic athletes. Together, those alternate reality Olympians created a new history of the games for an online audience of more than 2.9 million.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en277" id="Ref-en277"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">7</sup><br class="calibre2"/>7</a></div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">FOR MCDONALD’S</b> and AKQA, The Lost Ring was innovative marketing. Instead of delivering a typical television commercial about McDonald’s support for the Olympics, they would create a branded game that gave players an opportunity to become actively immersed in the Olympics. For the International Olympic Committee, it was a chance to help make a long-standing tradition more relevant to the gamer generation.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">For me, it was an opportunity to create a world-class global collaboratory. That’s why every element of The Lost Ring was designed to challenge players to practice extraordinary cooperation, coordination, and cocreation.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To inspire global cooperation, we used the strategy of massively distributing game content in different languages, on localized Web communities, and across far-flung real-world geographic locations in order to make it impossible for any single country, let alone a single player, to experience the game alone.  Key online game clues were hidden on regional websites and social networks—for example, the social network Hi5, which is popular in Argentina; the video-sharing site 6rooms, which is popular in China; and Skyrock, a popular blogging community in France. And, of course, physical game objects were hidden in virtually every corner of the world. None of these clues or objects was redundant; each added an important piece of information to the history of the lost sport. Players therefore needed to work together to collect everything and translate it for other players. To do so, they had to radically expand their collaboration horizons, pinging their way through multiple levels of extended social networks to find people capable of showing up at the right place and the right time, or translating one language into another, so someone else could accomplish the next step in the chain that would lead them to their goal.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We also adopted the strategy of telling what gamers call a “chaotic story.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en278" id="Ref-en278"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">8</sup><br class="calibre2"/>8</a> Instead of presenting players with a single means of consuming the game story, we broke it into thousands of pieces like a jigsaw puzzle and then diffused it across many different media platforms: podcasts and blog posts; videos and online photographs; e-mails and Twitter posts from game characters; even live instant message conversations and face-to-face interactions with characters portrayed by “game masters.” This kind of chaotic storytelling mode forces players to actively make sense of the game content for themselves and for each other, using collective intelligence skills and collaborative authoring platforms. Until players put a chaotic story together, it doesn’t really exist—it’s just a web of evidence, the raw materials for a story. It’s up to the players to do the actual final storytelling, which typically occurs on a wiki that ultimately represents an “official” story of the game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In the case of The Lost Ring, the players pieced together the chaotic story and worked through the translation challenges primarily on a special Find the Lost Ring wiki they created. By the end of the game, it contained a total of 730 audio, video, and image files, as well as 943 articles—all created by players. The site’s user-created pages included the Timeline, a detailed record of every major discovery and event during the six-month game; the Codex, a compilation of high-resolution scans of the twenty-seven manuscript pages  found around the world, accompanied by their translation into nine additional languages; and Labyrinth Training Reports, where best times, videos, and other details of significant training events were recorded.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Of course, beyond the chaotic storytelling, the lost sport itself was designed to require intense collaboration. The rules of the game were cooperative—and they ensured that players would train locally as a team to improve their collective performance as a group, as opposed to competing locally with other athletes. For teams who became good at the game, the synchronized movement would provide a collective experience of flow similar to group dancing. And as in all of my live-action games, I snuck in some oxytocin-releasing touch—the wall members joining hands or gripping each other’s shoulders—in order to strengthen the players’ cooperative bonds. By making the human labyrinth together, they would be engaged in cocreating a peak experience.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But beyond the rules of the sport, what really required intense cooperative effort and coordination was the simple fact that no one had ever played this human labyrinth sport before. No one would know the rules and no one would be any good at it yet. Together, the participants would have to bootstrap their way to mastering the sport. They would have to work together as a global network to discover—to invent—the ins and outs of the sport for the very first time, to teach each other their best tricks, and to spread the secrets of the game online to as many people as possible. Players started scheduling their training sessions to maximize the number of time zones that could participate at the same time in normal waking hours. They spontaneously decided to stream video of their training sessions live via cell phone networks so that other cities’ teams could watch and learn. These were extraordinary acts of coordination.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Finally, mass collaboration works only when everyone in the “mass” has something useful to contribute. Everyone needs to be given an opportunity to contribute from a position of personal strength—who they are and what they do best. So as I developed The Lost Ring as a collaboratory, one of my primary goals was to pioneer a system for helping players identify their own signature strengths, in order to help guide them to the kinds of contributions they could most effectively make in the game. That’s why one of the centerpieces of the Lost Ring Codex was the legend of six ancient strengths, each named for an  ancient Greek virtue, and each describing a distinctive way of contributing value to a group:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl">•  <i class="calibre6">Sofia</i>: I bring wisdom, creativity, and cleverness to our mission. I am one of the knowledge seekers.</div><div class="lsl">•  <i class="calibre6">Thumos:</i> I bring courage, energy, and determination to our mission. I am one of the adventurers.</div><div class="lsl">•  <i class="calibre6">Chariton:</i> I bring heart, humanity, and charm to our mission. I am one of the connectors.</div><div class="lsl">•  <i class="calibre6">Dikaiosune:</i> I bring leadership, direction, and focus to our mission. I am one of the pilots.</div><div class="lsl">•  <i class="calibre6">Sophrosune:</i> I bring balance, self-control, and an open mind to our mission. I am one of the advisors.</div><div class="lsl">•  <i class="calibre6">Mythopoeia:</i> I bring optimism, vision, and artistry to our mission. I am one of the truth finders.</div></div></div>
<div class="fmtx3">The codex included a twelve-question test to help you identify your primary and secondary signature strength. Players would choose from sets of statements the one that described them best. For example:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl">•  I am an original thinker.</div><div class="lsl">•  I prefer to lead a life of adventure.</div><div class="lsl">•  I enjoy helping others.</div></div></div>
<div class="fmtx3">And:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• I like being in charge.</div><div class="lsl">• I am a fair and honest person.</div><div class="lsl">• I always see the beauty around me.</div></div></div>
<div class="fmtx3">(These choices respond to <i class="calibre6">sofia, thumos, chariton, dikaiosune,</i> <i class="calibre6">sophrosune,</i> and <i class="calibre6">mythopoeia</i>, respectively.)</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Although the game presented these six strengths as a kind of ancient lore,  in fact they are drawn directly from seminal positive-psychology research. In 2004, researchers Martin Seligman and Christopher Peterson published <i class="calibre6">Character Strengths and Virtues,</i> a manual with twenty-four such categories, divided into six groups: <b class="calibre5">wisdom and knowledge</b>—cognitive strengths that entail the acquisition and use of knowledge; <b class="calibre5">courage</b>—emotional strengths that involve the exercise of will to accomplish goals in the face of opposition, external or internal; <b class="calibre5">humanity</b>—interpersonal strengths that involve tending to and befriending others; <b class="calibre5">justice</b>—civic strengths that underlie healthy community life; <b class="calibre5">temperance</b>—strengths that protect against excess; and <b class="calibre5">transcendence</b>—strengths that forge connections to the larger universe and provide meaning.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en279" id="Ref-en279"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">9</sup><br class="calibre2"/>9</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Together with the Values in Action (VIA) Institute on Character, Seligman and Peterson devised a 240-question inventory for measuring the positive emotional strengths that contribute to our success and well-being in life.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en280" id="Ref-en280"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">10</sup><br class="calibre2"/>10</a> The goal of the inventory is “to help people evolve toward their highest potential,” and it’s the most scientifically validated test of personal character in the world. Yet many people have never heard of it, let alone taken it.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">I wanted players to be able to find their signature strengths as members of the Lost Ring community because I believe that this positive-psychology resource can play an important role in creating ways for large numbers of people to contribute to a collaborative effort. So I modeled our ancient-strengths questionnaire on an abbreviated version of the official VIA inventory of strengths. My Olympic-themed twelve-question survey wasn’t scientifically validated—and it didn’t dive deep into the twenty-four strengths, just the six higher-order categories. But, as a first introduction to the strengths, I thought it would serve a powerful purpose: to help players start to identify their collaboration strengths and practice putting them to use in the Lost Ring mission.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Once they had completed the ancient-strengths test and had determined their primary and secondary strengths, players were invited to post strength badges on their social network pages, declaring, for example, “I am Sofia,” with a description of what that meant. These badges became a visual cue for other players to start keeping track of others’ strengths—in other words, they  were building up their collaboration radar. Eli Hunt and other game characters then began giving players game missions based on their strengths: for example, the brainy <i class="calibre6">sofia</i> players were challenged to research little-known facts about other games that really had been banned from the ancient Olympics, while the adventurous <i class="calibre6">thumos</i> players were given the task of going out into the real world to hunt down the physical artifacts, and the highly social <i class="calibre6">chariton</i> players were encouraged to be the social engineers of the game and figure out how to extend the social network of the Lost Ring community.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Even the lost sport itself had special roles for every kind of strength to play:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• <i class="calibre6">Sofia</i>: You are the best engineers. Study the labyrinth plans—and arrive early to design and build the labyrinth.</div><div class="lsl">• <i class="calibre6">Thumos</i>: You make the fastest runners. Get blindfolded and go for it!</div><div class="lsl">• <i class="calibre6">Chariton</i>: You are the best coaches. Cheer on your team and trash-talk others.</div><div class="lsl">• <i class="calibre6">Dikaiosune</i>: You make the best captains. Keep your team strong and focused on getting faster. Keep your wall coordinated and working together!</div><div class="lsl">• <i class="calibre6">Sophrosune</i>: You make the best referees. Make sure everyone follows the rules. Keep time of the best scores.</div><div class="lsl">• <i class="calibre6">Mythopoeia</i>: You tell the best stories. Take film and video of the game! And spread news of the best times from other cities—help your local team keep up-to-date on how the rest of the world is training.</div></div></div>
<div class="fmtx3">For players trying to recruit more athletes to participate in the lost-sport training events, and to engage the crowds of people who showed up to play but hadn’t been following the online story, the strengths test and assignments proved an excellent resource. It helped the experienced players give prospective players a meaningful way to contribute right away. It gave them a tool for directing new players to areas in which they were likely to experience success  and reap intrinsic reward—and it made sure that not one single potential contributor would find himself or herself without a satisfying task.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As Seligman and Peterson have often pointed out, we seem to be happiest when we are putting our signature strengths to good use in a group setting. The best evidence I’ve seen for this argument is when I watched Lost Ring players eagerly adopt their ancient-strength roles and perform them both online and in person as they brought the lost sport to life.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">When we first launched The Lost Ring, we did not know where it would go. We gave the players the raw materials for staging their own collaborative effort—a series of online urban legends and mysterious physical documents that suggested the potential to revive a lost Olympic sport—but would they do it? And if so, how?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We were confident we could bring together a global community with our chaotic, multilingual narrative. But would the community actually bring the lost sport back to life? Would they invent their own ways to get not just good at the sport, but Olympic-athlete good at it? When planning the game, we had playtested the lost sport only a few times, mostly with the creative team for the project, and collectively we were very slow and very bad at it. We never imagined the athletic feats that our players eventually made themselves capable of—indeed, no one had ever imagined such a feat until the players undertook it. The lost sport had never really existed—and it never would have, either, if not for the concerted effort of the global gamers.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Edwin Moses, a real gold medal-winning Olympic athlete and multiple world-record setter in the 400 meter hurdles, sat down with our creative team to watch videos of the best players on each continent. He seemed genuinely impressed with the teams’ performance and crafted individual video messages of support for each team. Later he answered players’ questions in a streaming online broadcast, giving serious advice to them about how to best prepare for a gold-medal event. Eventually, he joined us at sunrise on the Great Wall of China, one of the official Olympic event sites, to coach in person the Beijing lost-sport team in our alternate reality gold-medal race. When we had first conceived of a blindfolded human labyrinth race, I never would have imagined that our players would take the game to such a level of athletic excellence,  or that we would be able to genuinely engage and impress a real Olympic champion with the sport. But we did—thanks to the players’ collaborative efforts.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In the end, our players produced two extraordinary collaborative results: a complete, extensive history of the ancient lost sport and its modern day revival on the Find the Lost Ring wiki—a 943-page multimedia document coauthored by more than a thousand of the game’s leading players—and a community of athletes that made and raced labyrinths as if they had spent their entire lives (and not just six months) training for it. This was an act of true <i class="calibre6">emergensight</i> on the part of the players. From the complex, chaotic environment of Eli Hunt’s legends and the scattered mysteries of the codex, they saw the opportunity to forge a clear, collaborative path together: to create an epic work of alternate reality history, and to stage this awe-inspiring six-continent spectacle. As a result, I count the lead players of The Lost Ring—particularly the thousand most active players who took ownership of the wiki and coordinated the months-long training in the lost sport—among the true collaboration virtuosos of their generation.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We are all born with the potential to develop collaboration superpowers. Scientific research shows that we have both the ability and the desire from early childhood to cooperate, to coordinate activity, and to strengthen group bonds—in other words, to make a good game together. But this potential can be lost if we don’t expend enough effort practicing collaboration.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Fortunately, we have many collaboratories for doing so already. In addition to global alternate reality games like The Lost Ring, any good online game with co-op mode, collaborative production opportunities, and a thriving Wikia culture, for example, provides the perfect opportunity to practice collaboration superpowers. And thanks to the increasing availability of good games worldwide, we will have more and more opportunities than ever before to develop these superpowers.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">This is increasingly true even in developing countries, which traditionally have had limited access to leading-edge online games and game platforms. Today, game developers are creating online game platforms specifically for the technology constraints of emerging technology markets like India, Brazil,  and China. For example, the lower-priced game console Zeebo, which describes itself as “the video game console for the next billion,” connects low-energy-demand gamer consoles via mobile phone networks rather than broadband Internet. Meanwhile, networked games are being developed for the mobile phones that are ubiquitous even in the most isolated villages across Africa.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As the game industry continues to emphasize co-op, collective intelligence, and collaborative production modes of play, collaboration superpowers will spread more widely throughout gamer culture. And as more and more people start to think of themselves as gamers—perhaps in no small part because they want to develop their own collaboration superpowers—these extraordinary new skills and abilities will become ordinary—the norm rather than the exception.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So what can we do with the collaboration superpowers we develop over the next decade and beyond? One of the first epic goals for gamers worldwide may be simply to survive the twenty-first century.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In their 2006 book <i class="calibre6">Wikinomics</i>, the breakthrough manual for extreme-scale collaboration in the real world, Don Tapscott and Anthony Williams famously implored: “We must collaborate or perish—across borders, cultures, disciplines, and firms, and increasingly with masses of people at one time.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en281" id="Ref-en281"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">11</sup><br class="calibre2"/>11</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">“Collaborate or perish” is perhaps the single most urgent rallying cry for our times. The ability to collaborate at extreme scales isn’t just a competitive advantage in business or in life anymore. Increasingly, it’s a survival imperative for the human race. As the <i class="calibre6">Wikinomics</i> authors suggested several years later in an updated preface to the book, “The killer application for mass collaboration may be saving the planet, literally.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en282" id="Ref-en282"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">12</sup><br class="calibre2"/>12</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">A killer application is a program so valuable, it proves the core value of the larger system and drives massive amounts of people to adopt it; e-mail, for instance, was considered the killer app for home Internet access. I believe wholeheartedly that the core value of developing our collaboration superpowers will be proven by games that help gamers save the real world—by changing how we consume energy, how we feed ourselves, how we create better health, how we govern ourselves, how we conceive of new businesses, and how we take care of each other and the environment.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But these fundamental changes don’t happen overnight—surviving the twenty-first century together will require us to adopt longer horizons of thinking, acting, and collaborating. We need to play games that stretch our collective commitment months, years, or even decades ahead.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We need to start playing with the future.</div>
