<div class="ctag">HOW ALTERNATE REALITIES CAN HELP US ADOPT THE DAILY HABITS OF THE WORLD’S HAPPIEST PEOPLE</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">S</b>hout compliments at strangers on the sidewalk.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Play poker in a cemetery.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Dance without moving your feet.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Maybe these aren’t exactly your typical doctor’s orders. In fact, I’m pretty sure no psychologist has ever prescribed these activities. But each of these three unusual instructions <i class="calibre6">is</i> directly inspired by practical recommendations taken straight from positive-psychology manuals. For example:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• Practice random acts of kindness twice a week. (The reward center of the brain experiences a stronger “dopamine hit” when we make someone else smile than when we smile first.)</div><div class="lsl">• Think about death for five minutes every day. (Researchers suggest that we can induce a mellow, grateful physiological state known as “posttraumatic bliss” that helps us appreciate the present moment and savor our lives more.)</div><div class="lsl">• Dance more. (Synchronizing physical behavior to music we like is one of the most reliable—not to mention the safest—ways to induce the form of extreme happiness known as euphoria.)</div></div></div>
<div class="fmtx3">These three guidelines represent some of the most commonly prescribed happiness activities today; the first set of instructions just offers more <i class="calibre6">gameful</i> interpretations of them.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">What, exactly, are happiness activities? They’re like the daily multivitamins of positive psychology: they’ve been clinically tested and proven to boost our well-being in small doses, and they’re designed to fit easily into our everyday lives. There are dozens of different happiness activities in the scientific literature to choose from in addition to the three listed above, ranging from expressing our gratitude to someone daily to making a list of “bright-side” benefits whenever we experience a negative life event. And they all have one thing in common: they are backed by multiple million-dollar-plus research studies, which have conclusively demonstrated that virtually anybody who adopts one as a regular habit <i class="calibre6">will</i> get happier.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Of course, if it were <i class="calibre6">that</i> easy, we’d all be a lot happier already. In fact, by nearly all measures, we’re <i class="calibre6">not</i> substantially happier as a planet than we were before the rise of positive psychology in the 1990s. Rates of both clinical depression and mild depression globally are increasing so quickly, the World Health Organization recently named depression the single most serious chronic threat to global health, beating out heart disease, asthma, and diabetes.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en197" id="Ref-en197"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">1</sup><br class="calibre2"/>1</a> In the United States, where we frequently put on happy faces for each other in public, we admit in private to surprisingly low levels of life satisfaction. In one recent nationwide survey, more than 50 percent of U.S. adults recently reported that they “lack great enthusiasm for life” and “don’t feel actively and productively engaged with the world.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en198" id="Ref-en198"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">2</sup><br class="calibre2"/>2</a> This is despite the fact that we have—more than ever before—better and wider access to evidence-based self-help tools in the form of best-selling positive-psychology books, not to mention countless magazine articles and blog posts.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So what’s the problem? It turns out that <i class="calibre6">knowing</i> what makes us happy isn’t enough. We have to act on that knowledge, and not just once, but often. And it’s becoming increasingly obvious that it is just not that easy to put scientific findings into practice in our everyday lives.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We need help implementing new happiness habits—and we can’t just help  ourselves. In fact, when it comes to improving our collective happiness levels, self-help rarely works. Outside the structure and social support of a clinical trial or classroom, these self-help recommendations are surprisingly hard to implement on our own. Depending on the activity, we either <i class="calibre6">can’t</i> or <i class="calibre6">won’t</i> do them solo—and there are three big reasons why.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The first and most important reason is summed up best by Sonja Lyubomirsky, who laments, “Why do many of the most powerful happiness activities sound so . . . well, hokey?”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en199" id="Ref-en199"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">3</sup><br class="calibre2"/>3</a> Lyubomirsky earned a million-dollar research grant from the National Institute of Mental Health to test a dozen different happiness activities—and she discovered that despite their incontrovertible effectiveness, many people resist even trying them. The most common complaint, according to Lyubomirsky? Happiness activities sound “corny,” “sentimental,” or Pollyannaish.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en200" id="Ref-en200"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">4</sup><br class="calibre2"/>4</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">“Such reactions are authentic, and I can’t dispute them,” Lyubomirsky admits.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en201" id="Ref-en201"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">5</sup><br class="calibre2"/>5</a> We instinctively resist activities that feel forced and inauthentic, and many people are deeply suspicious of unadulterated feel-goodness. Shouldn’t expressions of gratitude be spontaneous, not scheduled? Isn’t it naive to constantly look for silver linings? What if I just plain don’t <i class="calibre6">feel</i> like making a gesture of kindness today? When it comes to doing good and feeling good, we seem to think it’s more “real” if we wait for inspiration to strike, rather than committing to doing it whether we “feel like it” or not. On top of that, there’s just plain suspicion and skepticism of these unabashedly positive activities. There’s an undeniable tendency toward irony, cynicism, and detachment in popular culture today, and throwing ourselves into happiness activities just doesn’t fit that emotional climate.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Positive psychologist Martin Seligman explains that “the pervasive belief that happiness is inauthentic is a profound obstacle” to putting positive psychology into action.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en202" id="Ref-en202"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">6</sup><br class="calibre2"/>6</a> Science just doesn’t have a chance against our instinctive, visceral reactions—and, unfortunately, the best advice that positive psychologists have to offer seems to push all our cynical, skeptical buttons. For many people, happiness activities will need to be embedded in a more instinctively appealing—and less overtly do-good, feel-good—package.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The second obstacle to practicing simple happiness activities on our own is what I call the “self-help paradox.” Self-help is typically a personal, private activity. When it comes to some activities—overcoming fears, identifying career goals, coping with chronic pain, starting a fitness routine—there’s certainly reason to believe that self-help can work. But when it comes to everyday happiness, there’s just no way personal, private activity can work—because, according to most scientific findings, there are almost no good ways to be happy alone for long.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As the author Eric Weiner, who has studied worldwide happiness trends, reports: “The self-help industrial complex hasn’t helped. By telling us that happiness lives inside us, it’s turned us inward just when we should be looking outward . . . to other people, to community and to the kind of human bonds that so clearly are the sources of our happiness.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en203" id="Ref-en203"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">7</sup><br class="calibre2"/>7</a> Weiner makes an excellent point here: self-help isn’t typically <i class="calibre6">social</i>, but so many happiness activities are meant to be. Moreover, positive psychology has shown that for any activity to feel truly <i class="calibre6">meaningful</i>, it needs to be attached to a much bigger project or community—and self-help just doesn’t usually unfold collectively, particularly when self-help advice comes in the form of books.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Approaching happiness as a self-help process runs counter to virtually every positive-psychology finding ever published. Even if we can get ourselves past the hokiness problem, thinking of happiness as a self-help process will doom us to failure. Ideally, happiness needs to be approached as a <i class="calibre6">collective</i> process. Happiness activities need to be done with friends, family, neighbors, strangers, coworkers, and all the other people who make up the social fabric of our lives.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Finally, there’s a self-help problem that isn’t unique to the science of happiness: it’s easier to change minds than to change behaviors. As Harvard professor of psychology Tal Ben-Shahar explains, we’re often more willing to learn something new than we are to actively adapt our lives. “Making the transition from theory to practice is difficult: changing deeply rooted habits of thinking, transforming ourselves and our world, requires a great deal of effort,” he writes. “People often abandon theories when they discover how difficult they are to put into practice.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en204" id="Ref-en204"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">8</sup><br class="calibre2"/>8</a> Either we never try or we get bored or frustrated quickly.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Toward the end of his best-selling self-help book <i class="calibre6">Happier</i>, Ben-Shahar makes one last effort to convince people to make practical use of what they’ve read: “There is one easy step to <i class="calibre6">un</i>happiness—doing nothing.” But unfortunately, that’s exactly what most of us do after we read a book or magazine article about happiness: absolutely nothing. The written word is a powerful way to communicate knowledge—but it’s not necessarily the most effective way to motivate people. We simply can’t self-help our way out of the depression epidemic. Alongside platforms for communicating the science of happiness, we need platforms for <i class="calibre6">engaging</i> people in scientifically proven happiness activities.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">And that’s where ideas like sidewalk compliments, cemetery poker, and stationary dancing come in.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Shout compliments at strangers, play poker in a cemetery, and dance without moving your feet are all instructions from large-scale public games that I’ve designed specifically with the intention of creating opportunities for as many people as possible to participate in happiness activities they wouldn’t ordinarily try.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">These “crowd games”—meant to be played in very large, and usually face-to-face, groups—are called Cruel 2 B Kind, Tombstone Hold ’Em, and Top Secret Dance-Off. And they’re all perfect examples of a new design practice called “happiness hacking.”</div>

幸福黑客的发明</h1>
<div class="fmtx">The term “hacking” has its origins in the 1950s, when MIT students defined it as “creatively tinkering with technology.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en205" id="Ref-en205"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">9</sup><br class="calibre2"/>9</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Back then, it was primarily radios that hackers were playing with, and it was a social activity: they would proudly show off their best hacks to anyone who would pay attention. Today, we most often think of hacking in the context of computing. You might associate the term “hacking” with malicious or illegal computer activity, but in the tech community it more commonly refers to clever, creative programming—especially if it takes a smart shortcut to accomplish something otherwise challenging. And as with the original  MIT hacks, there’s still a tradition of showing off and freely sharing successful hacks.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Recently, especially in Silicon Valley circles, “hacking” has been used more broadly to talk about a kind of creative, hands-on problem solving that usually, but not always, involves computers. A good example of this phenomenon is a movement called “life hacking.” Life hackers look for simple tips and tricks to improve productivity in everyday life—such as adopting the “ten/ two rule.” The ten/two rule means you work for ten minutes, and then let yourself do something fun and unproductive for two minutes—checking e-mail, getting a snack, browsing headlines. The theory is that it’s easy to commit your attention to work for just ten minutes at a time, and as a result you’ll get fifty good working minutes out of every hour. For many people, that’s a huge boost in productivity. To make it easy to adopt this habit, life hackers have created desktop and mobile phone applications that buzz alternately every ten and two minutes to keep you on track.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Life hacking positions itself in direct contrast to self-help; it’s meant to be a more collective way of working out solutions and testing them out together. As Merlin Mann, one of the leading life hackers, explains, “Self-help books tend to be about lofty ideas, whereas life hacks are about getting things done and solving life’s problems with modest solutions.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en206" id="Ref-en206"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">10</sup><br class="calibre2"/>10</a> Any good hack—whether it’s a computer hack or a life hack—should be free to adopt and extremely <i class="calibre6">lightweight</i>—meaning easy and inexpensive to implement—without any special equipment or expertise.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It was in this spirit that I coined the term “happiness hacking” several years ago.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en207" id="Ref-en207"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">11</sup><br class="calibre2"/>11</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3"><b class="calibre5">Happiness hacking</b> is the experimental design practice of translating <i class="calibre6">positive-psychology research</i> findings into <i class="calibre6">game mechanics</i>. It’s a way to make happiness activities feel significantly less hokey, and to put them in a bigger social context. Game mechanics also allow you to escalate the difficulty of happiness activities and inject them with novelty, so they stay challenging and fresh.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">When I design games today, I always embed at least one proven happiness  activity into the game mechanics—and sometimes I invent games based entirely on a handful of new research findings. It’s my way of enacting the tenth fix for reality:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">FIX #10: HAPPINESS HACKS</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">Compared with games, reality is hard to swallow. Games make it easier to take good advice and try out happier habits.</div>

幸福黑客 # 1: 释放陌生人的善意</h2>
<div class="fmtx">The two most frequently recommended happiness activities across the scientific literature are to express gratitude and practice acts of kindness. Recent research has shown that we don’t even have to know someone to experience the benefits of thanking and being nice to them. Even fleeting acts of gratitude and kindness toward strangers can have a profound impact on our happiness. And positive gestures from strangers can make a big difference in how rich and satisfying our everyday lives feel.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Sociologists call the positive relationships we have with strangers “transitory public sociality.” We experience it in all kinds of public places: sidewalks, parks, trains, restaurants, stadiums, and coffee shops, for example. These transitory social interactions, when they happen, are usually brief and anonymous: we catch another’s eye, we smile, we make room for someone else, we pick up something someone has dropped, we go on our way. But these brief encounters, taken cumulatively, have an aggregate impact on our mood over time.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Researchers have shown that sharing the same space for even just a few minutes a day with kind and friendly strangers makes us more optimistic, improves our self-esteem, makes us feel safer and more connected to our  environment, and generally helps us enjoy our lives more.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en208" id="Ref-en208"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">12</sup><br class="calibre2"/>12</a> And if we return the favor, we benefit as well: when we give to others, or act cooperatively, the reward centers of the brain light up.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en209" id="Ref-en209"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">13</sup><br class="calibre2"/>13</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">But strangers aren’t always inclined to be friendly to each other—and some researchers believe our shared spaces are becoming less friendly over time.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Dacher Keltner has devised a simple way to test this theory: a mathematical method for measuring the social well-being of any shared environment. It’s called the “<i class="calibre6">jen</i> ratio,” from the ancient Chinese word for human kindness. It compares the total positive interactions between strangers to the total negative interactions, in a given period of time and in a given place.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en210" id="Ref-en210"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">14</sup><br class="calibre2"/>14</a> The higher the ratio, the better the social well-being of the space and the happier you’re likely to feel after spending time in it. The lower the ratio, the poorer the social well-being, and the unhappier you’ll be if you spend too much time there.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To measure the jen ratio of a space, you simply watch it very closely for a fixed period of time—say, one hour. You count up all the positive and negative microinteractions between strangers, keeping track of two different totals: how many times people smile or act kindly toward each other, and how many times people act unfriendly, rude, or openly uninterested. All the positive microinteractions—such as big smiles, a hearty thank-you, a door being held open, a concerned question—get tallied on the left side of the ratio. All the negative microinteractions—a sarcastic comment, an eye roll, an unexcused bump, someone cursing under their breath—get tallied on the right side.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The jen ratio is a simple but powerful way to predict whether being in a particular place will make us happier or unhappier. When Keltner surveyed several years’ worth of recent research on social well-being and social spaces, he concluded, “Signs of a loss of <i class="calibre6">jen</i> in the United States are incontrovertible . . . with a jen ratio trending toward zero.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en211" id="Ref-en211"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">15</sup><br class="calibre2"/>15岁</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">So how can we raise the jen ratio of everyday shared spaces? The solution is obvious, if hard to enact: we need to convince large numbers of people to do things like smile more, be more welcoming, express more gratitude, or pay more compliments. Positive psychologists, of course, have already given us  this recommendation—but, as Lyubomirsky’s research shows, such recommendations rarely inspire direct individual action. Who wouldn’t feel daunted by the challenge of trying to increase the jen ratio of a big public space singlehandedly ? More likely, it would take a crowd, and not a single person, to effectively bump up the jen ratio. But there simply aren’t any well-established social traditions for going out and expressing gratitude or being kind to strangers together.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As a game designer, it is clear to me that we can tackle these problems by making this behavior more challenging and social. All it needs are a few arbitrary limitations, some multiplayer obstacles, and a feedback system in order to turn unlocking the kindness of strangers into a game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">So what exactly would a kindness game look like? And who would play it? These are questions I asked myself a few years ago, and, together with my good friend and fellow game developer Persuasive Games cofounder Ian Bogost, I decided to invent a game with the core mechanism of performing acts of kindness on strangers—as <i class="calibre6">sneakily</i> and <i class="calibre6">stealthily</i> as possible.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It would work just like the popular college campus game Assassins, in which players are assigned targets via e-mail, and then proceed to stalk each other across campus for days or even weeks to eliminate their targets with water guns and other toy weapons. But in our version, the game would be shorter (an hour or two) and confined to a much smaller space (a few city blocks, a park, or a large public plaza). And players wouldn’t kill each other with toy weapons—they’d kill each other with kindness. Most importantly, they wouldn’t be given specific targets, so anyone nearby was fair game for a thank-you or a compliment. And instead of being eliminated from the game when “killed,” players would join forces and cooperate with each other to keep performing bigger and more spectacular acts of kindness.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We called it Cruel 2 B Kind, or C2BK for short, after the famous line from Shakespeare’s tragedy <i class="calibre6">Hamlet</i>. We debuted it in 2006 in San Francisco and New York City; it’s since been played everywhere from Detroit, Michigan, and Johannesburg, South Africa, to Stockholm, Sweden, and Sydney, Australia. Here’s how it works: <div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1"><b class="calibre5">Cruel 2 B Kind</b> is a game of benevolent assassination. At the beginning of the game, you are assigned three secret weapons via e-mail or text message. To onlookers, these weapons will appear like random acts of kindness. But to other players, the friendly gestures are deadly maneuvers that will bring them to their knees.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Some players will be killed by a compliment. Others will be slain by a smile. You and your partner might be taken down by a happy offer to help.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">You can attempt to kill anyone else who is playing the game. However, you will have no idea who else is playing the game. You will be given no information a bout your targets. No names, no photos—nothing but the guarantee that they will remain within the game boundaries during the designated playing time. <i class="calibre6">Anyone</i> you encounter could be your target. The only way to find out is to attack them with your secret weapon.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Watch out: the hunter is also the hunted. Other players have been assigned the same secret weapons, and they’re coming to get you. Anything out of the ordinary you do to assassinate <i class="calibre6">your</i> targets may reveal your own secret identity to the other players who want you dead. So be cool when you attack. You don’t want to alarm innocent bystanders . . . or give away your secret identity.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">In many cases, you and another player will spot and attempt to kill each other at the same time! For this reason, the weapons are assigned powers according to the classic rock-paper-scissors model: a hearty welcome beats a thank-you, for example, or a killer compliment beats a wink and a smile. And if both players deploy the same weapon at the same time? It’s a standoff—you turn and run in the opposite direction, and both players must wait thirty seconds before attacking again. As  targets are successfully assassinated, the dead players join forces with their killers to continue stalking the surviving players. The teams grow bigger and bigger until two final mobs of benevolent assassins descend upon each other for a spectacular, climactic kill.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Will innocents be caught in the cross fire? Oh, yes. But when your secret weapon is a random act of kindness, it’s only cruel to be kind to other players ...</div>
<div class="centeraligned"><img alt="007" class="imgepub1" src="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_007_r1.jpg"/></div>
<div class="ctag1"><b class="calibre5">A team of C2BK players in London.</b> <br class="calibre2"/><i class="calibre6">(Alex Simmons for the Hide &amp; Seek Festival, 2008)</i></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In addition to this basic rule set, we created a database of possible weapons, and invited players to suggest their own. For example:<div class="liste"><div class="lsl">• Welcome your targets to beautiful [your neighborhood or city].</div><div class="lsl">• Tell your targets, “You look gorgeous today!”</div><div class="lsl">• Point out something amazing to your targets, such as, “Isn’t that an amazing bird!”</div><div class="lsl">• Praise your targets’ shoes.</div><div class="lsl">• Offer to help your targets with something specific. </div><div class="lsl">• Thank your targets for something they’re doing right now.</div><div class="lsl">• Express “mind-boggling” admiration of your targets.</div><div class="lsl">• Wink and smile at your targets.</div><div class="lsl">• Volunteer to answer any questions your targets have about something specific nearby.</div></div></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Besides swapping kind gestures for toy weapons, the two most important design decisions that we made were to shrink the window of play and to obscure the number and identity of players. In a regular game of Assassins, the game is too spread out physically and time-wise to have a significant impact on the local environment. By reducing the field and length of play, we “concentrated” the game to increase its impact and intensity. And in a traditional game of Assassins, players know exactly who they’re targeting. Bystanders <i class="calibre6">do</i> occasionally get caught up in the cross fire, but it’s always an accident, and it’s usually not fun for the victim. (No one wants to be unexpectedly splattered by a water gun if they’re not participating in a game!) In C2BK, however, we wanted bystanders to get hit—every positive microinteraction would increase the jen ratio, regardless of whether it improved the player’s score. In fact, the higher percentage of “misfires” (i.e. toward nonplayers), the better.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To be fair, being accidentally “attacked” by a player is somewhat startling—but also potentially enjoyable. In a best-case scenario, the “victims” of play feel genuinely welcome or complimented or appreciated. At the start of the game, when players are timid and groups are small, this tends to be the case. Later, as the players get bolder and teams get larger, strangers are more likely to be clued in to the unusual nature of the activity and provoked to wonder why everyone is making such showy efforts of gratitude and kindness. This is one of the intended effects of the game—to reveal if friendly gestures are considered out of place, and to provoke people to wonder why exactly that is. Of course, by the end of a game, being complimented by a horde of twenty or more adrenaline-pumping players is clearly no everyday act of transitory public sociality. No one is likely to mistake <i class="calibre6">that</i> for an ordinary act of kindness. But the spectacle works toward a different positive end: it adds a spark of novelty and curiosity to the environment. It’s bracing, but benevolent—and  our goal in including this level of spectacle was to jolt people out of their social bubbles.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Years of low jen ratios may make some bystanders more cynical and jaded than others—and for them, getting welcomed, serenaded, thanked, or complimented by a single stranger or a crowd of strangers might not initially be a positive experience. That’s why we were careful to playtest the various “weapons,” to whittle the list down to the most consistently positive-reaction-provoking gestures. I’ve also observed—and filmed—many C2BK games in action, specifically looking for signs that the majority of bystanders benefit, in addition to the players. To date, my studies have shown that the visible positive reactions—smiles, wide-eyed curiosity and amazement, cheerful replies—far outnumber the blank stares or negative reactions.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Ultimately, though, it’s the players who benefit most from the game. That’s because when you play C2BK, the basic happiness activities of expressing gratitude and practicing random acts of kindness are made more engaging.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">First of all, the C2BK game makes the kindness activities more interesting. There are two obstacles in the way of your performing them: you don’t know who to attack, and you’re trying to sneak past and avoid other players. Much of the game is spent scouring the environment for targets while trying to keep a low profile. You can’t help but wonder about everyone you see: Are they playing the game, too? Strangers become potential targets and allies, and the only way to find out if they share your secret is to interact positively with them.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">C2BK also produces adrenaline. Paying a compliment becomes an act of courage: you have to work up your nerve to overcome the social norms of ignoring strangers, and you have to do it as quickly as possible, because every second that passes is a second that another player could be targeting you. C2BK also has more pronounced fiero moments. Players and teams let out big hollers and cheers when they’ve made a successful kill, and the fiero moment is intensified by the number of misfires you’ve made on the way. My rough estimate from observing several games is that C2BK participants attack on average five times as many nonplayers as players.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The game also has more novelty than ordinary acts of kindness. It encourages you to think about being nice to strangers in different environments— and the possibilities are endless. It’s most frequently played in downtown settings, but Cruel 2 B Kind isn’t just a game for sidewalks and parks—any public or shared space could benefit from having its jen ratio raised. I’ve received reports of C2BK games played in settings as diverse as high-rise office buildings, arts festivals, libraries, shopping malls, convention centers, apartment complexes, college dorms, public train systems, and even the beach.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Finally, C2BK gives you collaborators in your happiness activity. You can gather up your friends to be on a team with you, and as you start getting folded into larger and larger groups—the biggest C2BK game I’ve participated in had more than two hundred players in a three-by-three city-block radius—you build up a sense of being on a collective mission to kill with kindness. It’s the kind of emotionally charged experience that can forever change how you see your own kindness capabilities. Even if you play C2BK formally only once or twice, you may find yourself continuing to think of friendly gestures as secret weapons you can deploy anytime, anywhere. (This is exactly what players report to me weeks and months after their first time playing the game.) The game gives you a different view into two happiness activities, charging them with more excitement, fiero, and social energy.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">CRUEL 2 B KIND,</b> like many happiness hacks, isn’t a product. There’s no software to download, no license to buy, no fee to pay. It’s meant to be a solution to a problem—the problem of how to increase the jen ratio of a shared space—and it can be adopted and adapted by anyone, anywhere. It was cheap to invent—Ian Bogost and I worked for free, and the whole project probably cost us less than five hundred dollars in expenses to playtest and launch.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The game can be played using any kind of mobile communications technology: text messaging, mobile e-mail, and Twitter are the most popular platforms for C2BK.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To help spread the hack, the Cruel 2 B Kind website includes a few essential tools. There’s a six-minute video showing the highlights of a game from start to finish, to help potential players get up to speed quickly. There’s also a  one-page “cheat sheet” with rules and frequently asked questions that players can print out and bring to the game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s hard to keep track of all the C2BK games that happen—game organizers don’t have to get our permission to run a game, so I rely on voluntary reports. Three years after launching the game, I still hear from new game organizers roughly every month. At the very least, C2BK has been played in more than fifty different cities, in ten countries, on four continents.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Recently, I received news of perhaps the most interesting C2BK setting yet: Summer Darkness, one of the biggest gothic festivals in Europe. The three game organizers wrote me an e-mail from the festival’s home city, Utrecht, in the Netherlands, explaining, “Ultimate goal: get the Goths (coming from all over Europe), and ‘civilians’ (non-Goths) to play together in the streets.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Now, if any group would find straightforward happiness activities hokey, I’m pretty sure it would be goths. The gothic subculture, of course, is known for embracing dark, mysterious, and morbid imagery. There’s a kind of loneliness and alienation deeply entrenched in gothic stories, music, and style. And Summer Darkness is officially billed as a “dark underground lifestyle” festival, so it might be the last place you’d expect to see people throwing themselves into extroverted interaction with strangers, let alone cheerful expressions of gratitude and random acts of kindness.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">For Cruel 2 B Kind to be an appealing activity to this community stands as excellent proof, I think, that even the most unabashedly do-good activity can be transformed into mischievous fun. It’s proof that happiness hacking works. You really can turn positive-psychology advice about what’s “good for you” into something that you really <i class="calibre6">want</i> to do.</div>

HAPPINESS HACK # 2: PLAYING OUR respect 幸福黑客2: 表达我们的敬意</h2>
<div class="fmtx">Tombstone Hold ’Em is a variation of Texas Hold ’Em poker designed to be played in cemeteries. It is also, without a doubt, the most controversial game I’ve ever designed.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To say that some people find the idea of playing games in a real-world cemetery inappropriate would be putting it mildly. In the United States in particular, we have a culture of grieving as quietly, as privately, and as solemnly as possible. Cemeteries—despite having been popular as public parks and recreation spaces in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries—today are largely single-use memorial spaces. They’re meant to be briefly occupied by mourners first and foremost. Some older or more scenic cemeteries may draw other visitors, but they generally move through them as inconspicuously as possible.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But I’ve never been prouder of a game design, and for one reason: players widely report being able to think about death and lost loved ones in a more positive way after playing Tombstone Hold ’Em. And that’s the point of the game. It’s a happiness hack meant to create more social, and more enjoyable, ways of remembering death.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Thinking about death is one of the most highly recommended happiness activities, but it’s also one of the most difficult to convince ourselves to undertake. We’re accustomed to pushing thoughts of death out of our minds, not cultivating them. Tombstone Hold ’Em is meant to make remembering death easier and more rewarding, by taking advantage of the largely underutilized social and recreational potential of cemeteries.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The central activity of Tombstone Hold ’Em poker is learning how to “see” a playing card in any tombstone, based on its shape (the suit) and the names and date of death (the face value). Once you can read stones as cards, you can spot “hands” all around you. The game works in any cemetery, as long as there are clearly marked tombstones. Here’s how it plays out:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">The key to understanding Tombstone Hold ’Em is that there are only four shapes you get on top of a tombstone. Pointy equals spades, statue on top equals clubs, rounded equals hearts, flat equals diamonds. That’s how you tell the suit.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Now take the last digit in the year of death. That’s your face value. Died 1905—that’s a five. Died 1931—the one is the ace.  But two names on the stone? Ignore the dates—that’s a jack. Three names is a queen. Four or more names is kings.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Now maybe you have to clear away some leaves or dirt or litter in order to read the cards. That’s good—it helps keep those old stones taken care of. Just be gentle with ’em.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Now, for a hand. You play it like regular Texas Hold ’Em, but in reverse. First, lay out the whole “flop” upfront. Five regular playing cards. Now everyone antes up, and then each pair (you’ve got to have a partner to play) has three minutes to find their two best hold cards.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">You can pick any two cards you want from anywhere in the cemetery—but you have to use the stones, not regular playing cards this time. The trick is you have to be able to <i class="calibre6">touch</i> both tombstones and each other at the same time. So maybe I’ve got a hand on a ten of hearts and the other on my buddy’s toe, while he’s stretched out to touch another heart for the flush. If we can’t make the reach, we can’t claim the cards.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">So find any pair you like and put a pair of poker chips on ’em to claim ’em. Now no other pairs can pick your two stones for their own pocket pair.</div>
<div class="centeraligned"><img alt="008" class="imgepub1" src="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_008_r1.jpg"/></div>

<div class="ctag1"><i class="calibre6">(Kiyash Monsef, 2005)</i></div>
<div class="fmtx2">All this has to happen fast, because after three minutes whoever’s got the working watch yells out, “Last call!” and everyone runs hell for leather back to the flop and says what they found. Only the best hand has to prove it, and winner takes all the antes. In the case of ties, first back to the flop is the winner.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">One more thing: no betting or bluffing in traditional Tombstone Hold ’Em. Only way to win is to earn it. So go out there with your partner and make sure you find the best pair.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en212" id="Ref-en212"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">16</sup><br class="calibre2"/>16岁</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Tombstone Hold ’Em allows players to actually get to know the people at rest in the cemetery. You read the stones, you learn the names, and you start to wonder about their stories—because every time you pick a pocket pair, you’re recruiting two dearly deceased as allies in the hand. Playing the game in a perfectly manicured cemetery is good, but playing it in a cemetery that could use a little loving care is better—it’s more challenging, and more rewarding. As you clear away clutter from the stones to make them legible again, you’re not just playing in the cemetery—you’re taking care of it.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The game is meant to be played by at least four people, and ideally in larger groups—the larger the group, the more enlivened the cemetery feels. I’ve organized large-scale Tombstone Hold ’Em games in historic cemeteries in Kansas City, Atlanta, New York City, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, for crowds ranging between twenty and two hundred. With a group that big, you’ve got a dozen or more “flops” going at the same time, spread out around the cemetery, on various benches, tree stumps, or mausoleum steps. Whenever I’ve organized a larger game, I’ve done so with the official permission and assistance of the cemeteries. But I’ve also played much smaller, unofficial games everywhere from Austin to Helsinki to Barcelona to Vancouver. If it’s a small group—say, four, six, or even eight players—it doesn’t raise too many eyebrows, especially if you’re sure to play well out of the way of anyone who might be visiting the cemetery for more traditional purposes.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But before I get too much further dissecting the experience of playing Tombstone Hold ’Em, perhaps I should explain how I came to be designing  a crowd game for cemeteries—and how happiness research convinced me to take on such an unusual project.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In 2005, I was working as a lead designer for a game company called 42 Entertainment. We accepted a commission to develop an alternate reality campaign for the Western-themed video game <i class="calibre6">Gun,</i> developed by Neversoft and published by Activision. The goal of the alternate reality campaign was to give gamers the chance to directly experience the historical world of <i class="calibre6">Gun</i>, the American Old West of the 1880s. The centerpiece of the alternate reality campaign was an online poker platform, styled in a Western theme. Gamers were invited to compete in online Texas Hold ’Em tournaments set in the past, competing at the same table with historical characters from the 1880s. It was a unique combination of historical role playing and card playing.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Alternate reality games usually have a real-world component, and since <i class="calibre6">Gun</i> featured real-world characters who’d died in the Old West, we came up with the idea of using real cemeteries as a site for some kind of live-action experience. Because of my expertise in running reality-based games, I was put in charge of figuring out what the live cemetery events would be.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">On one hand, I was excited by the concept. In a world where video gamers are much maligned for being desensitized to violence, it struck me as a particularly provocative idea to send gamers to the <i class="calibre6">real-world graves</i> of characters they had killed in <i class="calibre6">Gun</i>. But I also felt some trepidation, hitting up against the cultural norms involving cemeteries. I <i class="calibre6">really</i> didn’t want to organize some kind of rowdy, unauthorized “flash mob,” so I started researching historic cemeteries and brainstorming what kinds of things gamers could do in them.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">One of the first things I discovered was that cemeteries in the United States were absolutely <i class="calibre6">desperate</i> to convince people to spend more time in them. According to cemetery industry statistics, the average grave receives just <i class="calibre6">two</i> visits in its lifetime—<i class="calibre6">total</i>, by <i class="calibre6">any</i> friend or family member—after the initial flurry of visits that immediately follows the burial.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en213" id="Ref-en213"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">17</sup><br class="calibre2"/>17</a> We think of cemeteries as spaces for mourning, but the truth is, mourners do not regularly return. Meanwhile, others are generally discouraged by social norms from spending significant time in the space—it’s considered either unseemly or morbid.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As a result, cemeteries are for the most part empty. And lack of participation  in cemetery spaces has become a huge problem from an industry standpoint (cemeteries are running out of money), a community standpoint (the less visited a cemetery is, the more likely it is to be poorly maintained and vandalized), and, perhaps most of all, from a happiness standpoint (according to research, the less time we spend in cemeteries, the more likely we are to suffer from fear and anxiety about death).</div>
<div class="fmtx3">I was first tipped off to these problems by a <i class="calibre6">New Yorker</i> article about the decline of American cemeteries, which was published while I was in the midst of my research. In the article, Tad Friend documents how Americans today spend less time in cemeteries than ever before, despite the vast expanses of green space they take up and the escalating costs of maintaining them. “Who are cemeteries for? The living or the dead?” he asks. We’ve apparently convinced ourselves they’re for the dead, since we don’t visit them. But that’s ridiculous, as Tad Friends argues: “They’re for the living; the dead can’t enjoy them. The trick for cemeterians is to get the living to come to them.” He documents a range of fledgling efforts on the part of cemeteries nationwide to become more relevant to the living. There are, for example, movies projected at night on the sides of mausoleums in Hollywood, 5K graveyard races in Kansas City, and dog-walking clubs in historic Washington, D.C., cemeteries.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en214" id="Ref-en214"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">18</sup><br class="calibre2"/>18岁</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">As I researched the subject further, I discovered that many cemeteries were fighting for their very survival, and largely as a result of the American desire to keep the reality of death as far removed from our daily lives as possible. For decades private cemeteries have been quietly sold to accommodate new highways, schools, and condominiums; the graves are typically relocated to more remote areas. Meanwhile, many public and historic cemeteries receive insufficient funds to maintain the grounds properly; with such low visitation rates, they have a hard time documenting their value to the community. And abandoned cemeteries once belonging to now defunct churches are being adopted by local community groups in an effort to repair them and preserve their historical value.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en215" id="Ref-en215"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">19</sup><br class="calibre2"/>19</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">People who care about and run cemeteries make many good arguments in favor of protecting them: they are a unique repository of historical data, they have significant architectural value, and, not least of all, there is the ethical  imperative to honor contracts to families who have buried their loved ones with the expectation that they will be cared for in perpetuity.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">All of these are worthy reasons to enliven cemetery spaces today—but what really convinced me was the happiness research.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In his report on global happiness trends, Eric Weiner writes that death is “a subject that, oddly, comes up an awful lot in my search for happiness. Maybe we can’t really be happy without first coming to terms with our mortality.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en216" id="Ref-en216"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">20</sup><br class="calibre2"/>20</a> It’s a strange idea, but it’s not a new one. In <i class="calibre6">The Happiness Myth</i>, happiness historian Jennifer Michael Hecht devotes an entire chapter to “the age-old advice to remember death, to keep it in the forefront of our minds for the sake of bettering the life we lead now.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en217" id="Ref-en217"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">21</sup><br class="calibre2"/>二十一岁</a> She traces the idea all the way back to Plato, who advised students to “practice regular meditation upon death,” and to Buddha, who said, “Of all mindfulness meditations, that on death is supreme.” Even Epicurus, the ancient Greek philosopher best known for encouraging followers to seek simple pleasures, put death at the center of his vision of happiness, arguing that it is only when we shake free our fear of death that we can truly enjoy life.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">According to Hecht, since ancient times meditations on death have served the same purpose: to replace fear and anxiety with a kind of calm, mellow gratitude for the life that we’re given. And today, these traditions have the backing of contemporary science. Positive psychologists have found that grappling with the reality of death forces a kind of mental shift that helps us savor the present and focus our attention on the intrinsic goals that matter most to us. Hecht has coined a term for this realignment of priority and attention: posttraumatic bliss. “There are feelings in this life—good and bad—that cannot be conquered by intellect or force of will,” she writes. “Almost dying can realign you in a way that is the positive incarnation of trauma: posttraumatic bliss.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en218" id="Ref-en218"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">22</sup><br class="calibre2"/>22</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Researchers have documented the phenomenon of posttraumatic bliss among patients confronting a terminal medical diagnosis. Something seems to click in their minds, empowering them to enjoy their lives more. It’s not just that they’ve realized how precious life is; there seems to be some kind of significant mental clearing that occurs along with a new ability to focus on  positive goals. In <i class="calibre6">Happier</i>, Tal Ben-Shahar quotes Irvin D. Yalom, a psychotherapist who often works with dying patients: “They are able to trivialize the trivial, to assume a sense of control, to stop doing things they do not wish to do, to communicate more openly with families and close friends, and to live entirely in the present rather than in the future or the past.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en219" id="Ref-en219"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">23</sup><br class="calibre2"/>23</a> This rare and intense positive focus on getting the most out of life is hard to come by in our ordinary lives, Ben-Shahar notes—especially when we spend so much time collectively trying to avoid thinking about death.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Can we learn to savor life and achieve that intensity of positive focus without the trauma of a terminal diagnosis or a near-death experience? That seems to be the idea behind classical and religious advice, and today positive psychologists like Ben-Shahar recommend activities such as imagining ourselves on our deathbeds as a way to try to provoke this positive clarity.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But as a happiness activity, solitary deathbed reflection leaves a lot to be desired. It’s simply not something most of us are inclined to do—or if we are, we’re not likely to take it seriously or do it for very long. We can’t just tell ourselves to remember death—the ancient philosophers, Hecht notes, insisted that “it takes active meditations and gestures.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en220" id="Ref-en220"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">24</sup><br class="calibre2"/>24</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Moreover, it’s hard to force ourselves to grasp the reality of our own individual mortality. It’s easier to acknowledge the universality of death—and that’s where cemeteries come in. Cemeteries present us with vivid, extreme-scale, irrefutable historical evidence of the one thing that connects us all, the one thing that makes it possible to enjoy life to the fullest—if only we felt inclined to spend more time in them.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">At this point in my research, I was convinced that spending more time in cemeteries was a worthy social goal—and that a graveyard game could do a lot more than bring a historical video game to life. The <i class="calibre6">Gun</i> project was the perfect opportunity for a happiness hack. And the key to making this happiness hack work would be to generate the kind of positive emotions we typically associate with crowd games—excitement, interest, curiosity, social connection—and simply unleash it in the physical context of a cemetery.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Once I started playtesting in cemeteries, the design pieces fell quickly into place. I knew I would need a focused activity that, in some respect, had  nothing to do with remembering death—that had to be the side effect, not the purpose, of the game. And since Texas Hold ’Em poker was a larger theme for the alternate reality campaign, it made perfect sense to bring the familiar game to the cemeteries.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But the poker needed to be site-specific and really needed to use the natural affordances of a cemetery—otherwise, you’d just play the game somewhere else, defeating the entire purpose. And that’s where the idea of using stones as playing cards came in. Tombstones are the single design feature that all cemeteries have in common, guaranteeing the game would be playable anywhere. And paying close attention to the content of the tombstones directly supported the goal of the happiness hack—each card you “decoded” meant literally staring death in the face, but in a way that wouldn’t provoke fear or anxiety.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As for the other design choices, I made it a partner game because this seemed like a good way to ensure that it was not just social, but also cooperative. Cooperation always provokes positive emotion and meaning in games, especially if a physical connection is involved. Meanwhile, touch is one of the fastest ways to build social bonds—holding hands, touching someone’s back, and patting a shoulder all release the oxytocin chemical that makes us like and trust each other. But, as Dacher Keltner’s positive-emotion research has shown, “We live in a touch-deprived culture.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en221" id="Ref-en221"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">25</sup><br class="calibre2"/>25</a> To put it another way, as Michelangelo said, “to touch is to give life”—and I couldn’t think of a better way to enliven a cemetery than to unleash a flood of oxytocin in the crowd.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en222" id="Ref-en222"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">26</sup><br class="calibre2"/>26</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">When a game is in motion, there’s an air of happy participation that simply isn’t the norm for cemeteries. It’s a distinct break from the typical atmosphere, usually one of quiet, solitary reflection or collective mourning. At the same time, small pockets of conversation often break out, among friends as well as strangers—people sharing small pieces of their own experiences with mourning and loss. This has unfolded at every Tombstone Hold ’Em game I’ve been to—it’s almost impossible not to, given the setting. In this way, the game perfectly serves its purpose: it simultaneously activates positive emotions and social bonds while putting us in the perfect environment to get our recommended daily reminder that we are all dust, and to dust we shall return.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Which brings us back to the potential controversy. Tombstone Hold ’Em  was featured in a number of news articles, and some online readers commented that the game seemed “disrespectful,” “insensitive,” or even “obscene.” Which raises the question: Is it appropriate to play games in a cemetery? Based on my direct experiences, absolutely. At more than a dozen trials I’ve organized of Tombstone Hold ’Em, participants have overwhelmingly agreed that this particular game <i class="calibre6">feels right</i> in the space—especially when the net result is that the tombstones receive more attention from the living and are better taken care of as a result.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Perhaps more than any other project I’ve worked on, Tombstone Hold ’Em has demonstrated one of the most vital powers of gameplay: it gives us explicit permission to do things differently. We are accustomed to being asked to behave and think unconventionally in a game. We’re used to being creative and playing outside of social norms when we’re inside the socially safe “magic circle” of a game. And the more people who come together to play an unconventional game like Tombstone Hold ’Em, the safer it feels. A crowd carries the social authority to redefine norms.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Does it really work as a happiness hack? I’ve played Tombstone Hold ’Em with hundreds of people and spoken with nearly every one of them about it immediately afterward. (The games are usually followed by social gatherings in restaurants or bars, a way to decompress after what can be an intense, emotional experience.) The most common reaction is that players felt “more comfortable” being in the cemetery after playing. Other words most commonly used to describe the experience were “strangely happy” and “relaxed,” as well as “grateful” and “connected” to the people at rest. I’ve even talked to visitors at the cemeteries who spotted some of our players in the distance and asked me about the game; just once did a visitor express dismay. Most often, I heard a variation of the following sentiment: that it’s nice to see a loved one’s final resting place not lonely and empty, but full of people running, smiling, laughing, and having fun together.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Since I first shared the rules online, the game has spread mostly by word of mouth—like most good hacks—and I periodically hear about Tombstone Hold ’Em games popping up in cemeteries around the world. It’s the best outcome possible for any happiness hack: a solution that’s been tested, proven,  and shared, and now continues to be passed around to those who can benefit from it. Today, Tombstone Hold ’Em lives on as a viral happiness solution—it’s free to adopt or adapt, and no products or special supplies or technology is required. All you need are a set of regular playing cards, something to use as poker chips (some people use coins or colored glass stones), and a way to invite friends or strangers to play their respects with you.</div>

<div class="fmtx">“As a happiness lesson, nothing could be more straightforward: if you get a chance to dance in a circle, get up out of your chair and do it.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en223" id="Ref-en223"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">27</sup><br class="calibre2"/>27</a> That’s Jennifer Michael Hecht’s advice in <i class="calibre6">The Happiness Myth</i>, and with good reason. Dancing together has been used throughout human history as a reliable source of a special kind of euphoria, the <i class="calibre6">dancer’s high</i>.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Dancer’s high is what we feel when endorphins (from the physical movement) combine with oxytocin (from touch and synchronized movement) and the intense stimulation of our vagus nerve (what we feel when we “lose ourselves” in the rhythms of the music and are part of a crowd moving together). It’s an expansive mixture of excitement, flow, and affection that is hard to experience any other way.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en224" id="Ref-en224"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">28</sup><br class="calibre2"/>28</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">But dancing in groups also makes many people feel embarrassed or awkward. Everything from self-consciousness to social anxiety to a general disdain for any kind of group participation can prevent us from joining or fully enjoying a dance.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To really dance your heart out in front of others, to not hold back at all, is a daunting proposition for many (although certainly not all) people. It requires letting go, and showing people a side of yourself—exuberant, unguarded—that you might ordinarily keep hidden. For some, revealing that side requires a lot of trust in the people around you. And, in fact, according to positive-psychology researchers, the necessity of trust is one of the reasons why dancing is such a powerful happiness activity.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">When we dance, we’re forced into an emotionally and socially vulnerable  state in which we have to hope and trust that others will embrace us, rather than judge us. At the same time, we’re given the opportunity to embrace others and help them feel more comfortable dancing. In other words, dancing with others is a chance both to receive and to express our compassion, generosity, and humanity. As a result, Dacher Keltner writes, “Dance is the most reliable and quickest route to a mysterious feeling that has gone by many names over the generations: sympathy, agape, ecstasy, jen; here I’ll call it trust. To dance is to trust.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en225" id="Ref-en225"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">29</sup><br class="calibre2"/>29</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">But first, we have to have both the <i class="calibre6">desire</i> to dance and the <i class="calibre6">nerve</i> to do it. Many of us are missing one or the other.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Some people, as a rule, just don’t like “getting involved.” And group dances in particular set off all kinds of hokiness alarms. It’s no coincidence that one of the best-known group dances is actually called the “hokey pokey.” If you’re not in the mood for dancing, when a big group dance breaks out at a wedding or a street festival, for instance, being dragged into it can feel incredibly forced and inauthentic.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Others have the desire, but simply lose the nerve.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The more I kept hitting up against the same happiness advice—dance more, in large groups if possible—the more convinced I became that there had to be a way to make it easier for introverted types who were more likely to watch from the sidelines to participate, and to give people who are already willing to dance together more daily opportunities. After all, even people who are ready and willing to dance anytime, anyplace, don’t get nearly enough opportunities. We simply don’t have a lot of everyday venues for dancing together. I began to wonder: how could we all sneak a few minutes dancing together into our <i class="calibre6">everyday</i> lives, not just the occasional weekend?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">My solution: take all the basic mechanics of a massively multiplayer online role-playing game, and swap in real-life <i class="calibre6">dance quests</i> and <i class="calibre6">dance-offs</i> for traditional role-playing quests and raids. I called it Top Secret Dance-Off, or TSDO for short, and I launched it as a stand-alone social network site dedicated to the adventure of dancing together.</div>
<div class="afmtx"><div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">ADVENTURERS WANTED. NO DANCING TALENT REQUIRED.</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">Welcome to Top Secret Dance-Off, an underground network of otherwise ordinary people seeking to activate the dance secret—an elusive power said to be hardwired into our brains, and requiring highly unusual dance experiences to unlock it.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Top Secret Dance-Off is an adventure you can undertake anywhere in the world. No dance skills or talent is required. In fact, you may find yourself rewarded more for awkward dancing than for a virtuoso performance. Activating the dance secret isn’t about being a good dancer. It’s about being a clever dancer, a brave dancer, and occasionally a stealthy dancer.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Adventures will involve undertaking a variety of challenging, top secret dance missions on video, sometimes in the privacy of your home, and sometimes in the most unlikely environments. You may play alone, or with your friends. Mask wearing or other disguises are required.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">As you try to activate the elusive dance secret, you’ll earn points by completing dance quests and participating in dance-offs. As you earn more points, you’ll level up. The higher the level, the more dance secret you’ve activated.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">For every quest you complete and every dance-off you enter, you’ll also be earning choreopowers, such as style, courage, humor, and coordination. Your choreopowers reveal <i class="calibre6">your</i> personal strengths as a top secret dancer—and all choreopowers are awarded by other members of TSDO, in the comments on your videos.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Full activation of the dance secret occurs at level 100. How do you get there? Just complete twenty-one increasingly challenging quests and win at least a dozen dance-offs, and you’ll be fully activated for life.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Dance Quest #1: Disguise yourself.</div>
<div class="fmtx1">Your first mission is to disguise yourself. After all, this <i class="calibre6">is</i> top secret.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">But we’re not talking a full disguise. That would make dancing . . . difficult. So, to keep your TSDO identity a secret from the rest of the world, you must create a lightweight disguise that <i class="calibre6">covers at least part of your face</i>. It might be a mask, a scarf, modified sunglasses, face paint, a wig, or . . . ? It’s your face. You decide how to hide it. But make sure you really like your disguise—because you’ll need to don the exact same one for <i class="calibre6">all</i> future quests and dance-offs. Batman and Wonder Woman didn’t make new suits every time they went out to save the world, did they? So pick something you like, and stash it somewhere safe—and secret. You’ll be needing it.</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Now: <i class="calibre6">Make a video</i> introducing yourself to the TSDO world. You must be 1) wearing your disguise and 2) dancing. Pick any song you like. BUT—and here’s the tricky party—<i class="calibre6">keep your secret weapons in check</i> for now. That means <i class="calibre6">no moving your feet</i>. Dance, but don’t move your feet. Like they’re locked in cement. Got it?</div>
<div class="fmtx2">Keep the video short—less than thirty seconds. Upload it to the TSDO site when you’re ready to unleash your top secret dance identity and start earning your choreopowers.</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Admittedly, this is not exactly dancing together, at least not in the traditional sense. Most of the dance quests and dance-offs involve dancing alone, then uploading a video to the Top Secret Dance-Off social network site. But the game serves two important purposes toward making it easier to dance together.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">First, by providing a goal-oriented, feedback-rich, obstacle-intensive environment for dancing, it makes dancing more motivating, fun, and addictive. In other words, it increases a person’s likelihood of dancing at all. Second, TSDO puts dancing, even dancing around your apartment alone, into a collective  social context. It still takes nerve to share your dancing with an online community—and it’s a real opportunity to express compassion, generosity, and humanity when we cheer on other players in the comments. In other words, the game is a hack for group dancing—a way to dance together alone, and make people more likely to dance together for real, in the future.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The heart of the TSDO experience is the never-ending list of potential dance quests, each of which adds a unique, unnecessary obstacle to dancing. By putting an obstacle in your way, TSDO makes it much harder to be self-conscious about dancing: you’re focused on completing the challenge, not necessarily on how you look. It also gives you permission to dance badly, by restricting “normal” ways of dancing. The first dance quest—to dance without moving your feet—is a perfect example of this design strategy in action: it automatically rules out pretty much any kind of traditional or obvious dancing. Excelling at stationary dancing requires silliness, creativity, or just plain enthusiasm—not necessarily grace, sexiness, strength, or whatever else we might associate with natural dance talent.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Other dance quests include missions like “Dance upside down,” “Dance in a crosswalk,” “Dance with a tree,” and “Dance to whatever was your favorite song exactly seven years ago.” In each case, successful dancing means creatively dealing with absurd limitations—including time limits, which are designed to make the quests easy to fit into your day. It’s meant to be like brushing your teeth—a little dancing every day goes a long way.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Meanwhile, the dance-offs—in which players form teams and earn points for every team member who submits a dance—require players to synchronize their efforts, even if they are dancing alone. In one of the most popular dance-offs, for example, called “Steal my bad move,” players invent a signature dance move and upload a video demonstrating it. Their team gets points for every player who successfully learns and repeats the same move in their own dance-off video.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">What else makes the game work? Some of the supporting design choices I made for Top Secret Dance-Off were simply twists on very traditional strategies for getting people to dance. Masks, for example, have always been an important part of persuading people to let down their guard, and play and  perform. They free us from the constraints of who we think we’re supposed to be and how we’re supposed to behave. For people who don’t see themselves as natural dancers, their TSDO disguise is meant to free them from that limiting self-identity.</div>

<div class="ctag"><i class="calibre6">(Top Secret Dance-Off by Avant Game, 2009)</i></div>
<div class="fmtx3">But the “top secret” theme isn’t just about practical considerations like obscuring player identity. It was also a lightweight way to create a kind of superhero mythology around dancing together. Dancing in front of others, after all, is an act of courage. And it’s a proven powerful force for good when you inspire others to dance. Treating players like top secret superheroes just for dancing is one way to playfully recognize the meaning that dancing holds for us, and the real individual strength required to do it.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Finally, perhaps one of the most effective design elements of Top Secret Dance-Off’s design isn’t even about dancing specifically—it’s actually an adaption of Keltner’s jen ratio to the online environment. I knew that in order for  TSDO to work, players would need to feel comfortable posting potentially embarrassing videos of themselves. But on most video-sharing sites, the comments section is not exactly the kindest or friendliest place on earth. Criticism, rather than support, is the general method of feedback there, and it’s often personal, ugly, and mean-spirited. So I designed the comments feature of TSDO specifically to inspire players to leave positive feedback, or none at all.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Whenever you watch another player’s dance video, you have the option to reward them with a plus-one of any choreopower you want. Some choreopowers are traditional dance qualities, such as beauty, coordination, and style. Others are less traditional: humor, sneakiness, imagination, and courage. The range of choreopowers allows players to develop a unique profile of dance ability and strengths, regardless of their “natural” dance talent (or lack thereof). Perhaps my favorite choreopower is exuberance, which can be awarded to anyone who is obviously joyous and carefree.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As a result, TSDO is an environment with an off-the-charts high jen ratio. It’s a place where anyone can feel safe dancing together. Indeed, more than one player has professed in the TSDO chat room that their dance quest videos were the first time anyone has seen them dance publicly in years.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Top Secret Dance-Off is a more formal hack than Cruel 2 B Kind or Tombstone Hold ’Em. There’s a single, central game site, and everyone plays as part of the same online community, leveling up in the same database. But it’s still an incredibly lightweight solution, from a development perspective—I launched the game within a few days of starting to design it. It’s built on top of the inexpensive service Ning, which lets anyone start their own social network, much the way YouTube enabled anyone to share videos online and Blogger enabled anyone to start their own blog. There aren’t fancy graphics or Flash sequences, just good mission design and community support.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">I created TSDO as a happiness hack for my own life, and I hoped to play it with a few dozen friends and family members. It wound up attracting a much larger group than I’d expected. The extended social network grew to include coworkers and colleagues, acquaintances and friends of friends—all  in all, about five hundred of us in total played the game together for eight weeks during its initial trial run in early 2009. (And based on its early success, a commercial version of TSDO is now in the works.)</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Although TSDO can be played alone, from my observations TSDO dancing is usually at least a little bit social. Most players seem to recruit at least one partner in crime when they play, so they can film each other’s dance quests and compete in the same dance-offs. And many players create group disguises for two, three, four, or even five people who plan to complete all the quests together as a single top secret unit.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Most important, TSDO helps players think of themselves as dancers—which seems to make them much more likely to dance together <i class="calibre6">in person</i>, when the opportunities arise. Though this isn’t a scientific survey, all of my friends who have played TSDO, myself included, have found themselves dancing more often in a traditional group venue—at parties, at Bollywood dance clubs, even street festivals—long after they finished the game.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Like all of the best happiness hacks, you don’t have to keep playing to maintain the benefits. A good game is <i class="calibre6">that</i> powerful—it can change the way you see yourself and what you’re capable of forever.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">WHETHER WE’RE KILLING</b> each other with kindness, turning tombstones into full houses, or dancing in disguise, there’s no way around it: sometimes we have to <i class="calibre6">sneak up</i> on our happiness.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Two hundred years ago, the British political philosopher John Stuart Mill suggested a subversive approach to self-help. It’s an approach that has much in common with the growing community of happiness hackers. Mill argued that while happiness might be our primary goal, we can’t pursue it directly. It’s too tricky, too hard to pin down, too easy to scare off. So we have to set other, more concrete goals, and in the pursuit of those goals, we capture happiness as a kind of by-product. He called this approaching happiness “sideways, like a crab.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en226" id="Ref-en226"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">30</sup><br class="calibre2"/>30</a> We can’t let it know we’re coming. We just kind of sneak up on it from the side.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">That’s exactly what happiness hacks are designed to help us do: approach  happiness sideways, and as a group. In fact, with crowd games, it might be more accurate to say that hacks let us <i class="calibre6">encircle</i> happiness—we’re all sneaking up on it from different angles together. We play these crowd games because we enjoy them in the moment and because we crave the social connectivity of a multiplayer experience. But a few intense and memorable exposures to a happiness hack can shift our ways of thinking and acting in the long run, about things as diverse as kindness to strangers, dancing, and death. And if you get enough people to shift in one place, you really can change the larger culture.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The best part about happiness hacks is that it doesn’t take a lot of technological know-how or sophisticated development to create one that works. It just takes a good understanding of how games motivate, reward, and connect us. With the creativity to invent some unnecessary obstacles and the courage to playtest them with as many people as possible, anyone can dream up and share new solutions to the happiness challenges of everyday life.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Alternate reality games of all kinds are designed to make us better: happier, more creative, and more emotionally resilient. When we are better in these ways, we are able to engage with the real world more wholeheartedly—to wake up each day with a stronger sense of purpose, optimism, community, and meaning in our lives.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But big crowd games, which are the subject of the next part of this book, can do more than make us better. They can help solve some of the most urgent challenges we face as the human species.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It turns out that our ability to make ourselves better as individuals—to dive into more satisfying work, to foster real hopes of success, to strengthen our social connections, to become a part of something bigger—also helps us work together, longer, on more complex and pressing problems. Games aren’t just about improving our lives today—they can help us create a positive legacy for the future.</div>
