<div class="fmht"><b class="calibre4">CHAPTER FIVE</b></div>
<div class="fmht"><b class="calibre5">Stronger Social Connectivity</b></div>
<div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">M</b>ore than 5 million people are playing the online word game Lexulous on Facebook. And most of them are playing it with their moms.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">When the game was released in 2007, it became the first Facebook application to achieve a mass audience, and the familiarity of the gameplay was one of its main attractions. If you know how to play Scrabble, then you already know how to play Lexulous<i class="calibre6">—</i>it’s just a slightly modified and unauthorized version of the classic board game, combined with online chat.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en93" id="Ref-en93"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">1</sup><br class="calibre2"/>1</a> There’s no time limit on turns, and games stay active even when you log out of the social network. Whenever it’s your turn, Facebook sends you an alert to your home page, your e-mail, or your mobile phone.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Here’s how one Lexulous reviewer sums up its cross-generational appeal: “Everyone in your social network, even your mom, knows how to play Scrabble.” <a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en94" id="Ref-en94"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">2</sup><br class="calibre2"/>2</a> No doubt that’s why so many of the online rave reviews include the phrase “my mom”—like this one: “I live in Atlanta, and my mom’s in Texas. We love to have game night across the miles. Although I am sure she needs a break from me kicking her butt all of the time. (Love you, Mom!)”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en95" id="Ref-en95"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">3</sup><br class="calibre2"/>3</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">I’ve been reading game reviews for most of my life and I’ve never seen anything close to this many mom references. In fact, it’s not that much of a  stretch to say that, for many, the primary reason they play <i class="calibre6">Lexulous</i> is to have an excuse to talk to their mom every day.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s not just online reviews that have given me this suspicion—there’s photographic evidence as well. Lexulous games are private, but players often post screenshots of their most triumphant moments on photo-sharing sites like Flickr and Photobucket. In these screenshots, which usually have titles like “Online Scrabble with Mom” or “In Which I Beat My Mother at Lexulous,” you get a glimpse of the kind of everyday familial checking-in that runs alongside the wordplay.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en96" id="Ref-en96"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">4</sup><br class="calibre2"/>4</a> Much of the chat is mundane game talk, but you also see a constant stream of catching up, like these messages spied on Flickr: “Have you started your internship yet? How is that going?”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en97" id="Ref-en97"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">5</sup><br class="calibre2"/>5</a> and “Knee still hurt. Putting a lot of ice on it.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en98" id="Ref-en98"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">6</sup><br class="calibre2"/>6</a> Or “What are you doing after work?” and “Your stepfather says hello.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en99" id="Ref-en99"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">7</sup><br class="calibre2"/>7</a> Some chat messages simply express users’ happiness to be playing together, like this one from a mom to two daughters: “Glad to see you two, even if you do spank me when we play. :)”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en100" id="Ref-en100"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">8</sup><br class="calibre2"/>8</a> Of course, there are tons of messages that simply say: “I love you.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en101" id="Ref-en101"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">9</sup><br class="calibre2"/>9</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Judging from the shared screenshots, it’s not <i class="calibre6">just</i> moms whom players use Lexulous to keep in touch with daily. There are also plenty of running games against dads, cousins, siblings, in-laws, former coworkers, faraway friends, and spouses on business trips. (That’s when I most frequently play Lexulous—I keep a game running against my husband when I’m traveling for work. It helps me feel like we’re actually doing something together, not just checking in.)</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Because you don’t have to be online playing at the same time, it’s easy to organize a game with anyone else, no matter where or how busy they are. You can easily keep up with the game by playing literally only a few minutes a day. And by keeping running games going with your real-life friends and family, you’re ensuring daily opportunities to actively connect with the people you care about most.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The tight-knit nature of the Lexulous game world wasn’t a necessary outcome of the game’s design. On Facebook, you can technically start a Lexulous game with anyone—even people you don’t know—but most people play against people they already count as Facebook “friends.” Playing Lexulous is  checking in with our loved ones, but with a purpose. For anyone who has ever needed a gentle reminder to stay in touch, Lexulous provides a motivation. It helps us stay actively connected, by reminding us that it’s literally “our turn” to say something. And when there’s a game on the line, suddenly staying in touch is not just pleasant and gratifying—it is also addictive.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The secret to the addictiveness of Lexulous is its <i class="calibre6">asynchronous</i> gameplay: players don’t have to be online at the same time, and can take their turns whenever they want. Some Lexulous games go quickly, with players trading words every few minutes, but many games go quite slowly, with players taking just one or two turns a day, or even less often than that.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The unpredictable rhythm of asynchronous play adds a measure of anticipation. You’re thinking about your next play, but you don’t know when you’ll be able to make it. You’re motivated to act, but you have to wait for your Facebook friends to check back into the game. And because you often have no idea if your friends are still logged on or paying attention to the game, there’s an emotional buildup to waiting for their next moves. As one player puts it, “You have to be addicted AND patient.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en102" id="Ref-en102"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">10</sup><br class="calibre2"/>10</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">The addictiveness of the game pushes us to initiate social interaction with members of our extended social network whom we might ordinarily leave out of our daily life online. Indeed, starting a new game with someone is making a commitment to interact with them at least a dozen or so times in the near future. And when you’ve got five or ten or twenty games going at once, you’ve effectively scheduled hundreds of microinteractions with people you like into your everyday routine.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">According to user metrics reported in an article in the <i class="calibre6">Wall Street Journal</i>, on average one-third of registered Lexulous players at any given time have logged in at least thirty straight days in a row.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en103" id="Ref-en103"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">11</sup><br class="calibre2"/>11</a> This is a measure of the remarkable <i class="calibre6">stickiness</i> of social network gaming—it capitalizes brilliantly on the increased motivation we feel when we play a good game. It leverages our increased interest and optimism to help us satisfy our often otherwise thwarted desire to feel more connected with friends and family.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Simply put, social network games make it both <i class="calibre6">easier</i> and <i class="calibre6">more fun</i> to  maintain strong, active connections with people we care about but who we don’t see or speak to enough in our daily lives.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Eric Weiner, an independent foreign correspondent and author of <i class="calibre6">The Geography of Bliss,</i> has covered happiness trends throughout the world. His research has confirmed for him that “our happiness is completely and utterly intertwined with other people: family and friends and neighbors.... Happiness is not a noun or verb. It’s a conjunction. Connective tissue.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en104" id="Ref-en104"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">12</sup><br class="calibre2"/>12</a> Games like Lexulous are intentionally designed to strengthen the connective tissue within our social networks. Each move we make in the game is a conjunction.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We clearly need more social conjunctions in our lives. As numerous economists and positive psychologists have observed, globally we make the mistake of becoming less social the richer we become as individuals, and as a society. As Weiner observes: “The greatest source of happiness is other people—and what does money do? It isolates us from other people. It enables us to build walls, literal and figurative, around ourselves. We move from a teeming college dorm to an apartment to a house and, if we’re really wealthy, to an estate. We think we’re moving up, but really we’re walling off ourselves.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en105" id="Ref-en105"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">13</sup><br class="calibre2"/>13</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Games like Lexulous can help us start chipping away at those walls. Lexulous was the first breakthrough social network game, but since its success, the genre has experienced dramatic growth—particularly on Facebook. In early 2010, a virtual farming game called FarmVille hit an astonishing benchmark: 90 million active players on Facebook, nearly 30 million of whom log in on any given day to harvest their virtual crops and tend to their virtual livestock.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en106" id="Ref-en106"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">14</sup><br class="calibre2"/>14</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s an unprecedented scale of participation in a single online game. Roughly one in seventy-five people on the planet is currently playing FarmVille, and one in two hundred people on the planet logs in on any given day to manage and grow their virtual farm. What accounts for this global popularity? FarmVille is the first game to combine the blissful productivity of <i class="calibre6">World of Warcraft</i> with the easy gameplay and social connectivity of Lexulous.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Half the fun of FarmVille is earning experience points and gold in order to level up and earn access to better crops and farm equipment, more exotic animals, and a bigger land plot. Every time you log in to the game, you can improve your stats by undertaking a series of simple, point-and-click tasks:  plow the soil, buy and plant the seeds, harvest the crops, pet your farm animals. Each crop takes between twelve hours and four days in real time to yield a harvest, so checking in every day or so becomes a regular habit. You start the game able to harvest just strawberries and soybeans on a humble two-by-six-square plot. Over time, you can work your way up to a “mighty plantation” plot of twenty-two by twenty-two squares, on which you can grow lilies, yellow melons, and coffee—not to mention care for bunny rabbits, pinto horses, and golden chickens.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But the real genius of FarmVille is the social layer on top of this immensely satisfying self-improvement work. The first time you log in to the game, you see a list of your real-life Facebook friends who are already tending their own virtual farms. You can make any or all of them your “neighbors” in the game and visit their farms whenever you want to see how they’re doing.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">You don’t interact directly with these neighbors—instead, like most Lexulous play, FarmVille is an entirely asynchronous experience. While you’re tending your own farm, pop-up windows nudge you to pay attention to your friends’ and families’ farms: “Chelsea could use help on her farm. Can you give her a hand?” or “Ralph’s crops are looking a little puny. Could you please fertilize them?” Most players spend up to half their time in FarmVille helping others: raking up their leaves, shooing away raccoons, or feeding their chickens. You can also send your neighbors one free gift every day—a virtual avocado tree, a bale of hot pink hay, or a duck, for instance. Meanwhile, whenever you log back in to the game, you’ll see a list of neighbors who have helped your farm, and you’re likely to find a pile of presents to accept.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The gifts aren’t real, of course. The favors don’t help you in your everyday life. But the gesture isn’t an empty one. Every gift or favor someone bestows upon you helps you achieve your goals in the game. And it’s a virtuous circle. Every time you see that someone has helped your farm, you feel the urge to reciprocate. Over time, you build up a rhythm of checking in and helping others in your social network every single day.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s not a good substitute for real interaction, but it helps keep extended friends and family in our daily lives when we might otherwise be too busy to stay connected. Games like Lexulous and FarmVille ensure we’ll show up and  do our part to nurture our relationships daily, and make a gesture of friendship whenever it’s our turn.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">And so we have our fifth fix for reality:<div class="afmtx1"><div class="ctbt-t"><b class="calibre5">FIX #5: STRONGER SOCIAL CONNECTIVITY</b></div>
<div class="fmtx1">Compared with games, reality is disconnected. Games build stronger social bonds and lead to more active social networks. The more time we spend interacting within our social networks, the more likely we are to generate a subset of positive emotions known as “prosocial emotions.”</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Prosocial emotions—including love, compassion, admiration, and devotion—are feel-good emotions that are directed toward others. They’re crucial to our long-term happiness because they help create lasting social bonds.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Most of the prosocial emotions that we get from gaming today aren’t necessarily built in to the game design; they’re more of a side effect of spending more time playing together. Case in point: my husband and I first fell in love when we spent six weeks in each other’s apartments playing a mystery adventure game called <i class="calibre6">Grim Fandango</i> on my laptop. Falling in love wasn’t so much anything about that game in particular as it was a result of spending so much time working together to solve puzzles—not to mention negotiating who got to control the mouse and keyboard, and when—in order to lead us through the virtual world. Similarly, any pair or group of people who consistently play a game together, online or face-to-face, will have increased opportunities to express admiration for each other, to devote themselves to a common goal, to express sympathy for others’ losses, and even to fall in love. (Which reminds me of the most interesting comment I’ve eavesdropped on by browsing Lexulous screenshots: “Quite a close game again. Loser has to marry the winner?”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en107" id="Ref-en107"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">15</sup><br class="calibre2"/>15岁</a>)</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But beyond this kind of all-purpose social benefit to playing games together, there are two specific prosocial emotions that games give us: <b class="calibre5">happy embarrassment</b> and <b class="calibre5">vicarious pride</b>. Let’s take a look at why these two prosocial emotions matter, and how online games generate them better than real-world interaction.</div>
<div class="calibre2"><a id="h1"><br class="calibre2"/></a></div>
<h1 class="h"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Happy Embarrassment</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
快乐，尴尬</h1>
<div class="fmtx">If there’s one thing Lexulous players do even better than making obscure words out of random letters, it’s gently teasing each other in a way that makes them feel good. And the most effective way they tease each other is through trash-talking.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Trash-talking, when it’s a playful way to insult your competition, is almost as important to our enjoyment of social network games as the actual core gameplay. We crave the distinctly rewarding feeling we get from a good game when we soundly beat, or are beaten, by people we really like. More importantly, we crave the experience of teasing each other about it, in private <i class="calibre6">and</i> in public.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Consider, for example, the following public status updates from Lexulous players. These statements are visible to all members of their social network (including, no doubt, the people they are playing against), and sometimes to the whole world (which is how I happened to see them):<div class="afmtx1"><div class="fmtx1">“Playing Lexulous on Facebook with my mom. I’m winning. Hee hee hee!”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en108" id="Ref-en108"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">16</sup><br class="calibre2"/>16岁</a></div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx1">“I so pwnd my mom!”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en109" id="Ref-en109"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">17</sup><br class="calibre2"/>17</a></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="fmtx3">If you’ve never pwned your mom, you’re clearly missing out.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">To <i class="calibre6">pwn</i> someone—pronounced “pone” or “pawn,” though most people just type it—means to achieve such a major victory you can’t help but gloat afterward.  It originates from a common typo of the word “own,” since the letters <i class="calibre6">p</i> and <i class="calibre6">o</i> are next to each other on a standard keyboard; “own” has long been a popular gamer shorthand for the boastful comment “I’m so good at this game, I <i class="calibre6">own</i> it.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en110" id="Ref-en110"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">18</sup><br class="calibre2"/>18岁</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Why is game pwning such an increasingly popular form of social interaction? And why, when we’re on the receiving end, do we happily put up with it?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Teasing each other, recent scientific research has shown, is one of the fastest and most effective ways to intensify our positive feelings for each other. Dacher Keltner, a leading researcher of prosocial emotions at the University of California, has conducted experiments on the psychological benefits of teasing, and he believes that teasing plays an invaluable role in helping us form and maintain positive relationships.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en111" id="Ref-en111"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">19</sup><br class="calibre2"/>19</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">“The tease is like a social vaccine,” Keltner explains. “It stimulates the recipient’s emotional system.” Teasingly trash-talking allows us to provoke each other’s negative emotions in a very mild way—we stimulate a very small amount of anger or hurt or embarrassment. This tiny provocation has two powerful effects. First, it confirms trust: the person doing the teasing is demonstrating the capacity to hurt, but simultaneously showing that the intention is not to hurt. Just like a dog might play-bite another dog to show that it wants to be friends, we bare our teeth to each other in order to remind each other that we could, but never really <i class="calibre6">would,</i> hurt each other. Conversely, by allowing someone else to tease us, we confirm our willingness to be in a vulnerable position. We are actively demonstrating our trust in the other person’s regard for our emotional well-being.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">By letting someone tease us, we’re also helping them feel powerful. We’re giving them a moment to enjoy higher status in our social relationship—and humans are intensely attuned to shifts in social status. By letting someone else experience higher status, we intensify their positive feelings for us. Why? Because we naturally like people more when they enhance our own social status.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">This is the essence of happy embarrassment and, according to Keltner’s research, we’re hardwired to feel it. He has documented the physiological basis for this complicated social effect in studies of face-to-face playful teasing and trash-talking. According to Keltner’s findings, the recipient of the tease  almost invariably showed signs of lowered status, followed by an effort at reconciliation: gaze aversion, bowed head, nervous smile, hand touching the face, and so on. All of this is followed by a fleeting smile, a microexpression that indicates we actually enjoy being teased by people we trust. Meanwhile, the more obvious the display of lowered status, the more the teasers reported liking the teased afterward.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">None of this is a conscious process, Keltner’s research shows. We mostly tease and let ourselves be teased because it feels good. But the reason <i class="calibre6">why</i> it feels good is that it builds trust and makes us more likable. Most of us might not realize exactly why it enhances our social connection, but we definitely feel the emotional net positive after a teasing exchange. And this emotional reward encourages us to practice and repeat the behavior.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">With all the pwnage and trash-talking happening in our favorite social networking games, it’s clear that they are giving us a perfect and much needed space to practice and perform the good tease. Competitive games in particular give us an excuse to adopt playful postures of superiority, and to let our friends and family get away with the same.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We can also lower our status to strengthen our relationships by acting silly. This helps explain the appeal of the popular video game genre known as “party games.” A party game is a game that’s meant to be played socially, face-to-face, and is easy to pick up the first time you try. <i class="calibre6">Rock Band</i> is one of the most popular party games, and performing like a rock star—not to mention failing a set—in front of friends and family definitely qualifies as a status-raising or potentially happy-embarrassing moment.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Or consider <i class="calibre6">WarioWare: Smooth Moves</i> for the Wii, a game that is even more physical than <i class="calibre6">Rock Band</i>. (The Wii remote controller has an accelerometer that detects hand movements, as well as optical sensors to know where you’re pointing the device.) Like most party games for the Wii, to play it you have to perform it. <i class="calibre6">Smooth Moves</i> consists of more than two hundred different “microgames” that require you to do a silly physical movement quickly: flap your arms like a bird’s wing, mime twirling a hula hoop, shove virtual dentures into a virtual grandma’s mouth. You have five seconds to figure out what  you’re supposed to do, based on the images on the screen. Trying to think and move that quickly usually results in flailing around, goofy-looking gestures, and occasionally falling over.</div>

<div class="fmtx3">One reviewer reasonably asks: “Games this crazy shouldn’t be this popular, should they?”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en112" id="Ref-en112"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">20</sup><br class="calibre2"/>20</a> But they are hugely popular. <i class="calibre6">Smooth Moves</i> has sold more than 2 million copies. They are easy to learn and quick to deliver emotional rewards—if you’re willing to pick your virtual nose by shoving your game controller up and down, you really do trust the people around you.</div>
<div class="calibre2"><a id="h2"><br class="calibre2"/></a></div>
<h1 class="h"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Vicarious Pride</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
替代的骄傲</h1>
<div class="fmtx">In a recent major study of more than one thousand gamers, a little-known prosocial emotion called “naches” ranked number eight on the top ten list of emotions that gamers say they want to feel while playing their favorite games.  <i class="calibre6">Naches</i>, a Yiddish word for the bursting pride we feel when someone we’ve taught or mentored succeeds, ranked just below surprise and fiero.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en113" id="Ref-en113"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">21</sup><br class="calibre2"/>二十一岁</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">The term “naches” hasn’t caught on in the gamer world the way “pwn” or “fiero” has. But players in the study frequently described a kind of vicarious pride from playing over someone else’s shoulder, and giving advice and encouragement—especially on games they themselves had already mastered. The author of the study, Christopher Bateman, an expert in both cognitive psychology and game design, adopted the term “naches” to describe this phenomenon, reporting, “Players seem to really enjoy training their friends and family to play games, with a whopping 53.4 percent saying it enhances their enjoyment.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en114" id="Ref-en114"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">22</sup><br class="calibre2"/>22</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">It’s no surprise that mentoring our friends and family in gameplay makes us happy and brings us closer together. Paul Ekman, a pioneering emotions researcher and an expert on the phenomenon of naches, explains that this particular emotion is also likely an evolved mechanism, designed to enhance group survival. The happiness we get from cheering on friends and family ensures our personal investment in other people’s growth and achievements. It encourages us to contribute to someone else’s success, and as a result we form networks of support from which everyone involved benefits.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en115" id="Ref-en115"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">23</sup><br class="calibre2"/>23</a> And because naches is so strongly correlated with survival, Ekman says, we feel it intensely. We don’t describe ourselves as “bursting with pride” over our own success, but we do for others; this language suggests that the feeling of naches is even more explosive than personal fiero.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">However, we don’t naturally explode with pride at someone else’s success if we haven’t helped and encouraged them; too often, we feel jealousy or resentment. If we aren’t actively contributing to the achievement with our support, then our emotional systems don’t register vicarious pride. To generate the emotional reward of naches, we have to throw ourselves into the act of mentoring.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Most parents live in an almost constant state of naches. Unfortunately, outside of parenthood, we aren’t always alert to opportunities for naches—among friends, between husband and wife, or from children toward their  parents—because we don’t have significant incentive or encouragement to mentor each other in everyday school or work. For the most part, we live in a culture of individual achievement, or what Martin Seligman calls “the waxing of the self” and “the waning of the commons.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en116" id="Ref-en116"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">24</sup><br class="calibre2"/>24</a> He explains, “The society we live in takes the pleasures and pains, the successes and failures of the individual with unprecedented seriousness.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en117" id="Ref-en117"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">25</sup><br class="calibre2"/>25</a> And when we see success or failure as an entirely individual affair, we don’t bother to invest time or resources in someone else’s achievements.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">We need more naches, which helps explain the rise in single-player games being played with two or more people in the same room. Game researchers who study industry trends report that, increasingly, one person will play a game while another, or others, watch, encourage, and advise.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en118" id="Ref-en118"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">26</sup><br class="calibre2"/>26</a> What makes this scenario attractive—and here is a big difference between ordinary life and games—is that computer and video games are perfectly replicable obstacles, we know in advance that our support will be useful, and we know exactly what our friends and family members are getting themselves in for.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The notoriously difficult puzzle game <i class="calibre6">Braid,</i> by independent game developer Jonathan Blow, is a perfect example of this phenomenon. Players must work their way through thirty-seven monster-filled puzzle rooms in order to rescue a princess. Early reviews of the single-player game were raves, but many reviewers worried that the reliance on puzzles would limit the replay value of the game. Once you’d solved a puzzle, one reviewer wrote, “there is little incentive to come back for seconds.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en119" id="Ref-en119"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">27</sup><br class="calibre2"/>27</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">But a large amount of anecdotal evidence from gamer blogs and forums suggests that gamers are revisiting <i class="calibre6">Braid</i>—in order to generate naches. Players seem absolutely tickled to watch friends and family work out the a-ha moments for each puzzle, lending their advice and positive morale in the face of the game’s frustrating mental challenges. “Just finished the game, now I’m watching my wife work through it and it’s a delight,” one husband-turned-mentor writes.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en120" id="Ref-en120"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">28</sup><br class="calibre2"/>28</a> Another says, “I finished the game last night and only needed help from my kids on two of the very final puzzle pieces. I think they were very proud of their mom!”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en121" id="Ref-en121"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">29</sup><br class="calibre2"/>29</a> Games give us the opportunity to learn and master new challenges, and usually we learn skills that we can pass on to the other gamers in our lives.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Not all the social rewards we get from playing games are about strengthening bonds with people we already know. Social contact with strangers can offer different kinds of emotional reward, at the right times. One of these rewards that is unique to massively multiplayer online game environments is something researchers call “ambient sociability.” It’s the experience of playing alone together, and it’s a kind of social interaction that even the most introverted among us can enjoy.</div>
<div class="calibre2"><a id="h3"><br class="calibre2"/></a></div>
<h1 class="h"><b xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Ambient Sociability</b> <br class="calibre2"/>
环境社交能力</h1>
<div class="fmtx">Sometimes we want company, but we don’t want to actively interact with anybody. That’s where the idea of playing alone together comes in.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">MMOs are famous for their collaborative quests and group raids. But it turns out that a majority of players prefer to play the game solo. An eight-month study of more than 150,000 <i class="calibre6">World of Warcraft</i> players discovered that players were spending on average 70 percent of their time pursuing individual missions, barely interacting with other players.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en122" id="Ref-en122"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">30</sup><br class="calibre2"/>30</a> The researchers, based at Stanford University and Palo Alto Research Center (PARC), found this surprising and counterintuitive. Why bother paying a monthly subscription to participate in a massively multiplayer game world if you are going to ignore the masses?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">The researchers conducted interviews to explore these findings and found that players enjoyed <i class="calibre6">sharing</i> the virtual environment, even if there was little to no direct interaction. They were experiencing a high degree of “social presence,” a communications theory term for the sensation of sharing the same space with other people.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en123" id="Ref-en123"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">31</sup><br class="calibre2"/>31</a> Although the players were not fighting each other or questing together, they still considered each other virtual company. The Stanford and PARC research team dubbed this phenomenon “playing alone together.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en124" id="Ref-en124"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">32</sup><br class="calibre2"/>32</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">One <i class="calibre6">World of Warcraft</i> player explains on her blog why she prefers to play alone together: “It’s the feeling of not being alone in the world. I love being around other real players in the game. I enjoy seeing what they’re doing, what  they’ve achieved, and running across them out in the world ‘doing their thing’ while I’m doing mine.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en125" id="Ref-en125"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">33</sup><br class="calibre2"/>33</a> What she describes here is actually a special kind of social presence: a presence enhanced by sharing goals and engaging in the same activities. The players can <i class="calibre6">recognize</i> each other because they have a common understanding of what they’re doing and why. Their actions are intelligible and meaningful to each other.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Ambient sociability is a very casual form of social interaction; it may not create direct bonds, but it does satisfy our craving to feel connected to others. It creates a kind of social expansiveness in our lives—a feeling of inclusion in a social scene, and access to other people if we want it. The Stanford and PARC researchers posited that introverted players were more likely to enjoy playing alone together, and recent cognitive science studies support this theory. The best explanation scientists have for why some people are extroverted while others are introverted has to do with two differences in brain activity.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">First, introverts in general tend to be more sensitive to external sensory stimulus: the cortical region of the brain, which processes the external world of objects, spaces, and people, reacts strongly in the presence of any stimulus. Extroverts, on the other hand, have lower cortical arousal. They require <i class="calibre6">more</i> stimulus to feel engaged with the external world. This makes extroverts more likely to seek higher levels of social stimulation, while introverts are more likely to feel mentally exhausted after lower levels of social engagement.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Meanwhile, extroverts tend to produce more dopamine in response to social rewards—smiling faces, laughter, conversation, and touch, for example. Introverts, in turn, are less sensitive to these social reward systems but highly sensitive to <i class="calibre6">mental</i> activity, such as problem solving and puzzling and solo exploration. Researchers say this explains why extroverts seem happier around other people and in stimulating environments: they are feeling significantly more intense positive emotions than introverted people.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">But some game researchers, including Nicole Lazzaro, believe that ambient sociability and lightweight social interaction can actually train the brain to experience social interaction as more rewarding. Lazzaro proposes that since introverts are so sensitive to the rewards of mental activity, which gaming provides, doing these activities in online social settings can create new, positive  associations for introverts about social experience. In other words, games like <i class="calibre6">WoW</i> may make introverts feel more comfortable with social interaction in general.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Studies have yet to be conducted to offer concrete support to this theory, but initial interviews and anecdotal evidence suggest it is worth further investigation. Our solo <i class="calibre6">WoW</i> player describes how she can be drawn into lightweight social interaction even as she makes her own way in the online world: “Chuck a heal there, apply a buff here, kill that thing that’s about to kill that player, ask for some quick help or information, join up for a spontaneous quick group.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en126" id="Ref-en126"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">34</sup><br class="calibre2"/>34</a> She remains open to these unexpected social interactions, and they are an essential part of why she likes to play alone together. She craves the <i class="calibre6">possibility</i> of “the spontaneous adventures that erupt between real people.”</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Why does this matter? Why is it a good thing for introverts to be open to more social interaction, and to find shared experiences more rewarding?</div>
<div class="fmtx3">In study after study, positive-psychology researchers have shown that extroversion is highly correlated with greater happiness and life satisfaction. Extroverts are simply more likely to seek out the experiences that create social bonding and affection. As a result, they are better liked and better supported than introverts, two measures that factor heavily into quality of life. Introverts want to be liked and appreciated, and they need help just as much as anyone else; they’re just not as motivated to seek out opportunities to build up that kind of positive social feeling and exchange.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en127" id="Ref-en127"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">35</sup><br class="calibre2"/>35</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Fortunately, as many gamers are discovering, ambient sociability can play a key role in building up a desire for social interaction in the most introverted of people. Ambient sociability is hardly a substitute for real-world social interaction. But it can serve as a gateway to real-world socializing—and therefore greater quality of life—by helping introverts learn to view social engagement as more intrinsically rewarding than they are naturally predisposed to do.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">GAME DESIGNER</b> Daniel Cookman writes that when gamers decide to play with strangers or with people they know in real life, they’re effectively choosing between “forging new relationships or strengthening old ones.... We  can ask which the stronger draw is: strong, safe relationships with existing friends, or weak, ‘risky’ relationships with new people.” Cookman says that, in most circumstances, he (and most gamers) prefers to strengthen existing relationships. The payoff is simply greater, and more clearly connected to our everyday lives.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Cookman is right that, on the whole, gamers make the choice to strengthen existing relationships—increasingly, online gamers report that they prefer to play online with people they know in real life. This is truer the younger a gamer you are. A recent three-year study of Internet use by young people in the United States revealed that gamers under eighteen spend 61 percent of their game time playing with real-life friends and family, rather than alone or with strangers.<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en128" id="Ref-en128"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">36</sup><br class="calibre2"/>36</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">But Cookman acknowledges that there is another factor to consider. Play with strangers or play with friends? “In order to answer this question in any meaningful fashion,” he writes, “you first need to answer a more personal question. ‘Are you lonely?’”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en129" id="Ref-en129"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">37</sup><br class="calibre2"/>37</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">We can’t discuss the social rewards of gaming without mentioning the positive role they play in helping us combat our feelings of loneliness. As a general rule, we’d rather play with friends. But if that isn’t possible, we’ll take strangers any day over playing alone. Cookman sums up the prevailing sentiment: “I’m not sure if having a stranger yell at me in [a first-person shooter game] will result in any long-lasting friendships, but it is certainly better than being alone.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en130" id="Ref-en130"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">38</sup><br class="calibre2"/>38</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">The gamer website Pwn or Die, popular with an audience of teenagers and young adults, has a short manifesto on “Ways Video Games Actually Benefit ‘Real Life.’” At the top of the list is simply staving off loneliness. “When there are no kids in the neighborhood, it is late at night, or your best friend is miles away, video games give you an opportunity to interact with other people and be social.”<a href="mcgo_9781101475492_oeb_nts_r1.xhtml#en131" id="Ref-en131"><sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">39</sup><br class="calibre2"/>39</a></div>
<div class="fmtx3">Would it be more rewarding to have a real-world space in which to have face-to-face interaction? Probably—there is significant evidence to suggest that social rewards are intensified by things like eye contact and touch. But  face-to-face contact isn’t always possible. Moreover, if we’re feeling depressed or lonely, we might not have the emotional reserves to get up and get out, or to contact a real-life friend or family member. Playing a game online, like ambient sociability, can be a stepping-stone to a more positive emotional state and, with it, more positive social experiences.</div>
<div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="calibre2"> <br class="calibre2"/></div><div class="fmtx"><b class="calibre5">FIFTEEN YEARS AGO,</b> political scientist Robert Putnam famously worried that the United States was turning into a nation of people who go “bowling alone.” In his hugely influential book about the collapse of extended community, he documented a worrying trend: that we are increasingly likely to hunker down and prefer the company of just a few people rather than participate in civic organizations or in a larger social context in general.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Putnam considered the collapse of extended community in our everyday lives to be a major threat to our quality of life, and he made this point so persuasively that, for years since, experts have debated the best ways to reverse it. Public institutions have also tried everything possible to rebuild the traditional community infrastructure. But, as gamers are finding out, rebuilding traditional ways of connecting might not be the solution—reinvention might work better.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Gamers, without a doubt, are reinventing what we think of as our daily community infrastructure. They’re experimenting with new ways to create social capital, and they’re developing habits that provide more social bonding and connectivity than any bowling league ever could.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">As a society, we may feel increasingly disconnected from family, friends, and neighbors—but, as gamers, we are adopting strategies to reverse the phenomenon. Games are increasingly a crucial social thread woven throughout our everyday lives. We’re using asynchronous social interaction in games like Lexulous and FarmVille to build stronger, stickier social connections. We’re spending more time teasing and mentoring each other in games like <i class="calibre6">Smooth Moves</i> and <i class="calibre6">Braid</i>, in order to build trust and intensify our social commitments. And we’re creating worlds of ambient sociability, as in <i class="calibre6">World of Warcraft</i>,  where even the most introverted among us have opportunities to develop their social stamina and get more social connectivity in their lives.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">Gamers, emphatically, are <i class="calibre6">not</i> gaming alone.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">And the more we game together, the more we get the sense that we’re creating a global community with a purpose. Gamers aren’t just trying to win games anymore. They have a bigger mission.</div>
<div class="fmtx3">They’re on a mission to be a part of something <i class="calibre6">epic.</i></div>
