<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="drop">T</span>he gloom and the fog are beginning to lift. Life is appearing far more manageable now that you have adopted your “Pollyanna” attitude. As you begin to put your newfound positiveness into action and make some longed-for changes, you suddenly find that something is amiss with the people in your life. Both inside and outside your home, you begin to realize that some of the significant people in your life don’t seem to like the changes in you—even if the old you was a total wreck! What is happening?<br class="calibre4"/>阴霾和迷雾开始消散。既然你已经采取了“盲目乐观”的态度，生活似乎变得更容易掌控了。当你开始把你新发现的积极性付诸行动，并做出一些渴望已久的改变时，你突然发现你生活中的人有些不对劲。无论是在家里还是在家外，你开始意识到你生命中的一些重要人物似乎并不喜欢你的变化——即使过去的你是一个彻头彻尾的废物！到底发生了什么？</p>
<p class="calibre9">What is happening is that others have become accustomed to interacting with you in a certain way, and when that pattern of interaction is broken, there is usually upset of varying degrees. Even when you understand it, this upset can be very disturbing. Not only are you fearful of moving forward, you are now fearful of losing your relationships. Just when you are in need of a cheering squad, you find yourself faced with enemy troops!<br class="calibre4"/>正在发生的是，其他人已经习惯于以某种方式与你互动，当这种互动模式被打破时，通常会有不同程度的不安。即使你理解了这一点，这种不安也会非常令人不安。你不仅害怕向前看，你现在还害怕失去你的人际关系。就在你需要一个啦啦队的时候，你发现自己面对的是敌人的军队！</p>
<p class="calibre9">Before I discuss how to deal with family members who are having a hard time with your growing, take a good hard look at the people in your life generally. Do they support your growing or do they drag you down? Do you feel good being around them or do you feel “contaminated” by their negativity? Are they excited about the new you that is emerging or would they prefer the company of the old you that you are outgrowing? If the latter part of all three questions is true, it is time to consider making some changes.<br class="calibre4"/>在我讨论如何处理那些在你成长过程中遇到困难的家庭成员之前，先好好审视一下你生活中的一般人。他们支持你的成长还是拖累你？你和他们在一起感觉良好吗? 或者你觉得他们的消极情绪“污染”了你？他们是对新出现的你感到兴奋呢，还是更喜欢那个已经超越你的旧你的陪伴？如果这三个问题的后半部分都是正确的，那么是时候考虑做出一些改变了。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Keep in mind that your goal is to move yourself from pain to power in the way you hold your fear, and remember this:<br class="calibre4"/>记住，你的目标是通过控制恐惧的方式将自己从痛苦转变为力量，并且记住:</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">IT IS AMAZINGLY EMPOWERING </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
这是令人惊讶的赋予力量
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF A STRONG, MOTIVATED, </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
有一个强大的，有动力的,
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">AND INSPIRATIONAL GROUP OF PEOPLE.</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
和鼓舞人心的团队。
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">If you are now cringing with the realization that the people in your life belong in the weak, stuck, and depressed category, don’t worry. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Awareness</em> of this fact is the key to the solution. Most of us are <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">not</em> aware that we belong to the moan-and groan crowd until we stop moaning and groaning. When we become aware, things automatically start to take care of themselves.<br class="calibre4"/>如果你现在意识到你生命中的那些人属于弱者、卡壳者和抑郁者，不要担心。意识到这个事实是解决问题的关键。我们大多数人都没有意识到我们属于呻吟和呻吟的群体，直到我们停止呻吟和呻吟。当我们意识到这一点的时候，事情就会自动开始照顾好自己。</p>
<p class="calibre9">How? It’s quite simple. As you begin to grow, you will notice that you no longer want to be around depressing people. Negativity is contagious, and you walk away feeling lousy after spending time in the company of a negative person. Positiveness is contagious as well, and spending time with a positive person makes you feel as though you can sprout wings and fly. Soon you’ll become discerning. Energy is tangible, and as you become more aware, you will “feel” if a person is positive or negative . . . and you’ll be automatically drawn to the more positive. The people in your life are a good indicator of where you are operating on an emotional level. Like attracts like. As you begin to change, you will automatically draw and be drawn to a different kind of person.<br class="calibre4"/>怎么做到的？很简单。当你开始成长的时候，你会发现你不再想和沮丧的人在一起。消极情绪是会传染的，和消极情绪的人在一起一段时间后，你会感觉很糟糕。积极也是会传染的，和积极的人在一起会让你觉得你可以展翅高飞。很快你就会变得有洞察力。能量是有形的，当你越来越意识到的时候，你会“感觉”到一个人是积极的还是消极的，你会自动地被更积极的吸引。你生活中的人是一个很好的指示器，可以告诉你在情感层面上处于什么位置。喜欢吸引喜欢。当你开始改变的时候，你会自然而然地被一个不同类型的人所吸引。</p>
<p class="calibre9">When this is discussed in my classes, the question that always arises is: “That’s all well and good, but what do I do with the old friends I have outgrown?” Many of my students have expressed guilt at the thought of leaving old friends behind. This is understandable, but totally unwarranted. In the first place, they are assuming that their old friends are not strong enough to carry on without them. This is a bit presumptuous and more than a bit belittling to their friends. I can guarantee that as you withdraw from their lives, they will find new friends with whom to associate. The Moan and Groan Society will be around for many years to come, and your friends will always find a welcome home there.<br class="calibre4"/>当我在课堂上讨论这个问题时，总会出现这样的问题: “这样很好，但是我该怎么处理我已经不再需要的老朋友呢?”我的许多学生都对把老朋友留在身后的想法表示愧疚。这是可以理解的，但是完全没有根据。首先，他们认为他们的老朋友不够强大，没有他们就无法继续生活。这有点自以为是，也有点轻视他们的朋友。我可以保证，当你离开他们的生活时，他们会找到新的朋友来交往。呻吟与呻吟协会会在未来的许多年里一直存在，你的朋友们总能在那里找到一个受欢迎的家。</p>
<p class="calibre9">There is another possibility: your newfound energy may awaken your friends to new possibilities, and they may join you on your journey toward power, action, and love. That, of course, would be ideal. It is important to remember that, even with your old friends as company, you will want to expand your support system so that you will have all kinds of “advanced” role models to show the way.<br class="calibre4"/>还有另一种可能性: 你新发现的能量可能会唤醒你的朋友，让他们看到新的可能性，他们可能会加入你通往权力、行动和爱的旅程。这当然是最理想的。重要的是要记住，即使有老朋友作为陪伴，你也会想要扩大你的支持系统，这样你就会有各种“先进”的榜样来指引方向。</p>
<p class="calibre9">What kind of support system am I talking about? The kind that makes you feel <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">wonderful</em> about yourself. So that when you say you want to go back to school, or get a new job, or whatever, your friends will say, “I think that is a fantastic idea. You’ll do beautifully. Don’t worry . . . you have what it takes! Go for it!”<br class="calibre4"/>我说的是什么样的支持系统？让你自我感觉良好的那种。所以当你说你想回学校，或者找份新工作，或者其他什么的时候，你的朋友会说，“我觉得这是个好主意。你会做得很好的。别担心，你有这个能力！去吧!”</p>
<p class="calibre9">This is the kind of support I’m talking about, instead of: “Aren’t you taking a big risk? There’s so much competition out there, you’ll never make it. Why don’t you just leave things the way they are?” When you hear that kind of talk, it’s time to run the other way.<br class="calibre4"/>这就是我所说的那种支持，而不是: “你不是在冒很大的风险吗？竞争太激烈了，你不可能成功的。你为什么不让事情保持现状呢?”当你听到这样的言论时，是时候转身离开了。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Among the new friends you make, include those who are farther along the journey than you are at the moment. As Marilyn Ferguson states in her acclaimed book <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">The Aquarian Conspiracy:</em><br class="calibre4"/>在你结交的新朋友中，包括那些比你现在走得更远的人。正如玛莉琳 · 弗古森在她著名的《水瓶座的阴谋》一书中所说:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre6">
<p class="noindent">If we are to find our way across troubled waters, we are better served by the company of those who have built bridges, who have moved beyond despair and inertia.<br class="calibre4"/>如果我们要设法跨越这片混乱的水域，那些架起桥梁、摆脱绝望和惰性的人们将为我们提供更好的服务。</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">Although it is a great feeling to be able to lead people to a better place, it is also a relief to be led by others who can show you the way. Life becomes more fun and less of a struggle when you don’t have to pioneer on your own. There is a lightness about positive people. They have learned not to take themselves so seriously, and they are a joy to be around. This is not to say that positive thinkers are “flaky.” The Inside Edge, the group I mentioned in the last chapter, not only supports positive thinking but also supports people in expanding their own vision into the world to create a healthier planet. When we are concerned with something bigger than ourselves, our fears are greatly diminished. We sense ourselves as being part of a bigger whole—we are not alone and we, perhaps for the first time, are aware of a sense of purpose.<br class="calibre4"/>虽然这是一种伟大的感觉，能够带领人们到一个更好的地方，它也是一种解脱，被其他人领导谁可以给你带路。当你不必独自开拓时，生活会变得更加有趣，不再是一场挣扎。积极向上的人总有一种轻松愉快的感觉。他们学会了不把自己看得那么严肃，和他们在一起是一种乐趣。这并不是说积极的思考者是“古怪的”我在上一章提到的 Inside Edge 组织，不仅支持积极思考，还支持人们将自己的视野拓展到世界上，创造一个更健康的地球。当我们关心比我们自己更重要的事情时，我们的恐惧就会大大减少。我们感觉自己是一个更大整体的一部分——我们并不孤单，我们也许是第一次意识到目标的意义。</p>
<p class="calibre9">It is incredibly important to your peace of mind and sense of power to have some kind of support group. I can’t stress enough how important it is to begin <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">now</em> to have strong people in your life, in the form of an established group or simply a group of friends who are consciously in the process of growing. Again, don’t worry about your negative friends. It is more than likely that as soon as you stop agreeing with their victim act, they will either disappear or join you on the path to power and love.<br class="calibre4"/>拥有一些支持团体对于你的内心平静和权力感是非常重要的。从现在开始在你的生活中拥有强大的人是多么的重要，无论是以一个已经建立起来的团体的形式，还是仅仅是一群有意识地在成长过程中的朋友。再次重申，不要担心你的消极朋友。很有可能，一旦你停止同意他们的受害者行为，他们要么消失，要么加入你通往权力和爱的道路。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">How do you begin? Think about people you have recently met and really admire. Do some sleuthing to find out their telephone numbers. Call them up and tell them simply that you were impressed at the first meeting and that you would like to get to know them better. Then invite them to join you for lunch or dinner. I know this can be <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">very</em> frightening at first. The first time I did it, many years ago, my hand actually shook as I dialed the phone.<br class="calibre4"/>你怎么开始的？想想你最近遇到并且真正钦佩的人。做一些调查，找出他们的电话号码。打电话给他们，简单地告诉他们你在第一次见面时印象深刻，你想更好地了解他们。然后邀请他们和你一起共进午餐或晚餐。我知道一开始这可能会很吓人。很多年前，我第一次这么做的时候，我拨打电话的时候手都在发抖。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Much to my surprise, the woman I had chosen for my first new friend was thrilled that I had called. At that time my self-esteem was so low, I imagined she would do everything to avoid me. On the contrary, she told me she was really excited I had called. “You are?” was my insecure response. We had a delightful evening together, and continue to be good friends today. Initiating relationships became easier for me as time went on, and today I’m blessed with a circle of fantastic friends.<br class="calibre4"/>出乎我意料的是，我选择的第一个新朋友很高兴我给她打了电话。那时我的自尊心很低，我以为她会尽一切可能躲着我。恰恰相反，她告诉我她很高兴我打电话给她。“是吗?”是我没有安全感的回答。我们度过了一个愉快的夜晚，今天仍然是好朋友。随着时间的推移，建立关系对我来说变得越来越容易，今天我很幸运地拥有了一群很棒的朋友。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The point is that you must make the effort. So many people sit at home waiting for the phone to ring and wondering why they are always alone. Nothing is going to come to you—especially in the beginning. You have to go out and create the kind of support system you want. Even if it seems frightening, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">do it anyway</em>! Even if you get a few rejections, keep dialing. If you get one good response out of ten, that’s great. Remember that people are flattered by your interest, even if for their own reasons they reject your invitation. You will have made them feel good simply by calling. Be discriminating in who you call. Pick someone you perceive as being a few steps ahead of you in personal growth. It will be great for your self-confidence when you eventually find out that you’re way ahead of them in many areas. We do tend to greatly underestimate ourselves.<br class="calibre4"/>关键是你必须努力。很多人坐在家里等着电话铃响，想知道为什么他们总是一个人。什么都不会来找你——尤其是刚开始的时候。你必须走出去，创造一种你想要的支持系统。即使这看起来很可怕，无论如何也要去做！即使你遭到了一些拒绝，也要继续拨号。如果你在10个回复中得到一个好的回复，那就太好了。记住，人们会因为你的兴趣而受宠若惊，即使他们出于自己的原因拒绝了你的邀请。你只要打个电话就能让他们感觉良好。对你打电话的人要有辨别力。选择一个你认为在个人成长方面领先你几步的人。当你最终发现自己在很多方面都领先于他们时，这将对你的自信心大有裨益。我们确实倾向于大大低估自己。</p>
<p class="calibre9">A good place to find such people is at self-improvement classes, workshops, or seminars. There you will meet people already on the path of personal growth. You will have much in common, and the likelihood is that you will find more openness with such people.<br class="calibre4"/>找到这样的人的一个好地方就是自我提升课程，工作坊或者研讨会。在那里你会遇到那些已经在个人成长道路上的人。你们会有很多共同点，而且很有可能你会发现自己对这些人更加开放。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Now that you’ve got your friends in order, your next question might be: <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">“What do I do when my mate is the one who is dragging me down?”</em><br class="calibre4"/>现在你已经把你的朋友们安排好了，你的下一个问题可能是: “当我的伴侣是拖我后腿的那个人时，我该怎么办?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">This is an important question. It is often our mate who resists our growth most of all. Although we are often shocked and disappointed at his or her lack of support, it isn’t really so surprising. Our mates often perceive that they have much to lose when we begin rocking the boat. It might take a while for them to realize they have more to gain by our growth. The following two stories are extreme examples of how difficult it is for a mate to accept change—even if that change is from sickness to health.<br class="calibre4"/>这是一个很重要的问题。通常是我们的伴侣最抵制我们的成长。尽管我们经常对他或她缺乏支持感到震惊和失望，但这并不令人惊讶。我们的伴侣常常认为，当我们开始捣乱时，他们会失去很多东西。他们可能需要一段时间才能意识到我们的成长会给他们带来更多的好处。下面的两个故事是一个极端的例子，说明伴侣接受改变是多么困难——即使改变是从疾病到健康。</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Doris</em>
<br class="calibre4"/>
桃乐丝
</p>
<p class="calibre9">Doris was one of my earliest students. She lived in Garden City, Long Island, and for eighteen years had been too frightened to venture any farther. In fact, during the few years prior to her attending my class, she had hardly left her home. She was, as you might have guessed, an agoraphobic. My teaching is geared toward everyday fears, as opposed to phobias. Yet something drew her to my course.<br class="calibre4"/>多丽丝是我最早的学生之一。她住在长岛的花园城，十八年来她一直很害怕，不敢再往前走了。事实上，在她来上我的课之前的几年里，她几乎没有离开过家。你可能已经猜到了，她是一个广场恐惧症患者。我的教学是针对日常生活中的恐惧，而不是恐惧症。然而，有些东西吸引她来上我的课。</p>
<p class="calibre9">In order for her to get there, her husband, Ted, had to drive her into New York, take her up to the classroom and wait for her downstairs. She was too frightened to be on her own. When it was her turn to speak in the go-around, I could see the anguish on her face. She was panicked that she was going to have a panic attack.<br class="calibre4"/>为了让她到那里，她的丈夫 Ted 不得不开车送她到纽约，把她带到教室，然后在楼下等她。她太害怕了，不敢一个人呆着。轮到她说话的时候，我可以看到她脸上的痛苦。她惊慌失措，害怕自己会恐慌发作。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I used the technique called “paradoxical intention” on Doris, which, simply stated, was to encourage her to do the very thing she feared. What we resist, persists. So I told her <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">not</em> to resist and to show us what a panic attack looked like. As predicted, she couldn’t muster one up no matter how hard she tried, and ultimately she began to laugh, as did the rest of us. From that moment, she was on her way back to health. She was diligent about doing all the homework assignments, and within a short time she was driving, shopping, and even taking the subway. The class and I watched her transform before our eyes.<br class="calibre4"/>我对多丽丝使用了一种叫做“矛盾意图”的技巧，简单地说，就是鼓励她去做她害怕的事情。我们抵制的东西会持续下去。所以我告诉她不要抵抗，让我们看看恐慌症是什么样子的。正如我们预料的那样，无论她怎么努力，她都无法唤起恐惧，最终她开始大笑起来，我们其他人也是。从那一刻起，她开始恢复健康。她很勤快的完成了所有的家庭作业，不一会儿她就能开车，逛街，甚至搭地铁。全班同学和我都看着她在我们眼前转变。</p>
<p class="calibre9">One day she came into class a bit disturbed. She said, “As I begin to feel better and better, I’m realizing that my husband is trying to sabotage me. Every time I leave the house, he tries to put all kinds of fear thoughts into my head. When I come home excited about some new thing I’ve conquered, he withdraws and becomes very aloof. I’m so angry at him! I don’t understand what is happening! Why would he do that to me?”<br class="calibre4"/>一天，她有点不安地走进教室。她说: “当我感觉越来越好的时候，我意识到我的丈夫正在试图破坏我。每次我离开家，他都试图把各种各样的恐惧想法灌输到我的脑子里。当我回到家，对我征服的新事物感到兴奋时，他就会退缩，变得非常冷漠。我很生他的气！我不明白发生了什么事！他为什么要这样对我?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">To all of us who have dramatically changed our patterns of relating to people in our lives, the answer was obvious. Ted was doing it for a number of reasons. In the first place, he was threatened by her changes. Before she took the path to recovery, he had a wife who was always waiting for him at home. He never had to concern himself with suspicions of what she might be doing in the outside world. There was a tremendous security in that, even though their life was so limited as a result of her phobias.<br class="calibre4"/>对于我们这些戏剧性地改变了我们与生活中的人交往模式的人来说，答案显而易见。Ted 这么做有很多原因。首先，他被她的改变所威胁。在她走上康复之路之前，他的妻子一直在家里等着他。他从不担心她在外面的世界做什么。尽管由于她的恐惧症，他们的生活受到了极大的限制，但是他们却有着巨大的安全感。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Second, there was probably actual worry connected with his behavior. For years, she was a little bird in a cage. It was doubtful that any harm would come to her in the confines of their home, but now that she was out in the world, traveling the streets of New York, he was undoubtedly afraid that some harm would come to her. As we worry about our children crossing the street alone for the first time, he worried about his “child,” who in many ways was crossing the street for the first time.<br class="calibre4"/>其次，他的行为可能与真正的担忧有关。多年来，她一直是笼子里的小鸟。在他们的家里，她是否会受到任何伤害，这是值得怀疑的，但是现在她已经走出了这个世界，在纽约的大街上游荡，毫无疑问，他担心她会受到伤害。正如我们担心我们的孩子第一次独自过马路，他担心他的“孩子”，在许多方面是第一次过马路。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Last, her independence was worrying him. For so many years she had desperately needed him to function for her. Now she was functioning on her own. Would she continue to want him if the need was no longer there?<br class="calibre4"/>最后，她的独立让他担心。这么多年来，她一直迫切地需要他为她工作。现在她只能靠自己了。如果不再需要他，她还会继续需要他吗？</p>
<p class="calibre9">With these thoughts going through Ted’s head, no wonder he found it difficult to support Doris in her growth. As we talked about what he might be feeling, she began to realize that it was <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">he</em> who needed support from her. She admitted that her anger made it hard for her to give him any support. As she put it, “How do you reassure someone you feel like punching in the face!”<br class="calibre4"/>这些想法在 Ted 的脑海中闪过，难怪他发现很难支持 Doris 的成长。当我们谈论他的感受时，她开始意识到他需要她的支持。她承认她的愤怒让她很难给他任何支持。就像她说的那样，“你怎么才能让你想揍人的人放心呢!”</p>
<p class="calibre9">It took a while, but, happily for Doris and Ted, they were able to work through the changes that had to take place in order for the marriage to work on a healthier basis. What helped was the fact that Doris was sure that she would <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">never</em> go back to being the pathetic “shut-in” she used to be. If it cost her her husband, so be it! She felt entitled to health after all those years of suffering. It was, therefore, clear to Ted that his manipulations would not work. Either he adjusted or he would lose his wife. His ego was strong enough to overcome his feeling of threat and ultimately he became a tremendous support to Doris.<br class="calibre4"/>虽然花了一些时间，但是对于 Doris 和 Ted 来说，幸运的是，为了让婚姻更健康，他们能够克服必须发生的变化。多丽丝确信自己再也不会像以前那样可怜兮兮地“闭门不出”了，这一点对她有所帮助。如果这让她失去了她的丈夫，那就这样吧！在经历了这么多年的痛苦之后，她觉得自己有资格得到健康。因此，Ted 很清楚，他的操纵不会起作用。要么他调整，要么他会失去他的妻子。他的自我意识强大到足以克服他的威胁感，最终他成为多丽丝的巨大支持者。</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Rona</em>
<br class="calibre4"/>
罗娜
</p>
<p class="calibre9">The story of Rona and Bill is similar. Rona is now a beautiful woman who looks like she stepped out of a fashion magazine. Three years ago, she weighed 250 pounds. Her doctor warned her that if she did not lose weight, her health would be seriously impaired. With incredible will, she lost the weight and has maintained her slender figure. With the weight loss, a new woman has emerged.<br class="calibre4"/>罗娜和比尔的故事很相似。罗娜现在是一个美丽的女人，看起来就像从时尚杂志里走出来的一样。三年前，她的体重是250磅。她的医生警告她，如果她不减肥，她的健康将受到严重损害。凭着难以置信的意志，她减肥了，并保持了苗条的身材。随着体重的减轻，一个新的女人出现了。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As with Doris, Rona’s relationship with her husband went through many changes before he could accept the fact that he had a beautiful wife who attracted the attention of men wherever she went. Subtly, he tried to undermine his beautiful new wife by accusing her of flirting, denying her sex, buying her fattening food, and using other such devices.<br class="calibre4"/>和桃乐丝一样，罗娜和她丈夫的关系也经历了许多变化，直到他能够接受他有一个美丽的妻子这个事实，无论她走到哪里，都会吸引男人的注意。他巧妙地试图通过指责妻子调情、拒绝与她发生性关系、为她购买增肥食品以及使用其他类似手段来削弱她美丽的新婚妻子。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Bill is basically a kind man, so he was shocked when he realized that he felt threatened by the fact that his wife was becoming healthier. When he saw how destructive his insecurity was to himself and to Rona, he went for professional help. The marriage is now thriving.<br class="calibre4"/>比尔基本上是个善良的人，所以当他意识到妻子变得越来越健康这一事实让他感到威胁时，他感到震惊。当他看到他的不安全感对自己和罗娜造成了多大的破坏时，他去寻求专业的帮助。现在，他们的婚姻生活蒸蒸日上。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Not all relationships are as healthy as those of Doris and Rona, and change in the unwritten contract of the partnership can signal the end of the relationship. Although the thought that your relationship could break down may be very frightening, in actuality I know of <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no one</em> who has chosen the path of growth over his or her relationship who has regretted that choice!<br class="calibre4"/>并不是所有的关系都像 Doris 和 Rona 那样健康，合作关系中不成文的合同的变化可能预示着关系的结束。尽管认为你们的关系可能会破裂的想法可能是非常可怕的，但事实上我知道没有一个人选择了成长的道路而放弃了他或她的关系而后悔这个选择！</p>
<p class="calibre9">Here are two examples:<br class="calibre4"/>这里有两个例子:</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Richard</em>
<br class="calibre4"/>
理查德
</p>
<p class="calibre9">Richard had usually played it safe. He was an accountant who received a biweekly paycheck that supported him, his wife, and their two children. In his late thirties, he decided that there had to be more to life than he was experiencing. One of the companies for which he had done a great deal of work was available for purchase. It was a small computer company that showed a great deal of promise. When he discussed the idea of raising the capital and buying the company, his wife couldn’t deal with it—her financial security was threatened. Obviously, she had no confidence in his ability to make it work.<br class="calibre4"/>理查德通常谨慎行事。他是一名会计，每两周领一次薪水，供养他、他的妻子和两个孩子。在他快40岁的时候，他决定生活中必须有比他所经历的更多的东西。他为其中一家公司做了大量的工作，现在这家公司可以收购了。这是一家很有前途的小型计算机公司。当他谈到筹集资金并收购公司的想法时，他的妻子无法接受——她的经济安全受到了威胁。显然，她对他的能力没有信心。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Richard decided that for his own mental health, he had to give it a try. He might fail, but if he didn’t go ahead with it, he would spend the rest of his life doing what he didn’t want to do. Despite his wife’s disapproval, he made the purchase when he was finally able to raise the capital.<br class="calibre4"/>理查德决定为了自己的心理健康，他必须试一试。他可能会失败，但如果他不继续下去，他的余生都会在做他不想做的事情。尽管妻子不同意，但是当他筹到资金的时候，他还是买了下来。</p>
<p class="calibre9">His home situation changed drastically during the process. Naturally, the initial stages of running a new business require a great deal of time. He experienced nothing but resentment on the part of his wife. He got no support or encouragement from her. He asked her to become involved with him in the company, since their children were both able to take care of themselves. She refused.<br class="calibre4"/>在这个过程中，他的家庭状况发生了巨大的变化。很自然的，经营一家新公司的初始阶段需要大量的时间。除了妻子的怨恨，他什么也感受不到。他没有得到她的支持和鼓励。他要求她加入他的公司，因为他们的孩子都能照顾好自己。她拒绝了。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Their home became a battleground, and when he found himself happy to leave in the morning and unhappy to come home in the evening, he decided that it was time to end the relationship. To this day, his wife still considers him to be selfish and uncaring, simply because he wouldn’t play the game according to her rules.<br class="calibre4"/>他们的家变成了战场，当他发现自己早上高兴地离开，晚上不高兴地回家时，他决定是时候结束这段关系了。直到今天，他的妻子仍然认为他是自私和漠不关心的，仅仅因为他不按照她的规则玩游戏。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Richard ultimately got a divorce and made a marvelous success of the business. He grew, and his wife was not able to grow with him. He shudders when he looks back at where he would still be had he not taken the opportunity that presented itself. His sense of himself has dramatically altered for the better. He felt the fear . . . and did it anyway, even though it meant the breakup of his marriage. He is now remarried, to a woman who encourages his growth as he encourages hers. They are growing together.<br class="calibre4"/>理查德最终离婚了，并在生意上取得了巨大的成功。他成长了，而他的妻子却无法与他一起成长。当他回头看到如果他没有抓住这个机会，他现在还会在哪里的时候，他不寒而栗。他对自己的认识已经戏剧性地向好的方向转变。他感受到了恐惧... ... 无论如何他还是做了，即使这意味着他的婚姻破裂了。他现在再婚了，娶了一个鼓励他成长的女人，就像他鼓励她成长一样。他们一起成长。</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Sheila</em>
<br class="calibre4"/>
希拉
</p>
<p class="calibre9">Sheila also chose growth over an unhealthy relationship. She was married very young and had two daughters in the first four years of her marriage. It did not take long for dissatisfaction to set in, and, with the support of her husband, Roger, she went back to school to complete her education. While she was initially afraid that she had lost her ability to learn after an absence of five years, she was the star in her class and graduated magna cum laude. This success encouraged her to get her master’s degree and ultimately her doctorate.<br class="calibre4"/>希拉也选择了成长而不是不健康的关系。她很年轻就结婚了，在结婚的头四年里生了两个女儿。没过多久，不满情绪就出现了，在丈夫罗杰的支持下，她回到学校完成了学业。虽然她最初担心缺课五年后会失去学习的能力，但她是班上的明星，以优异成绩毕业。这种成功鼓励她获得硕士学位，并最终获得博士学位。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As long as she was a student, things seemed to go well with Roger. He was proud of his “little student” and he really was a marvelous help with the children. When she finally hung her doctoral diploma on the wall, after many years, her relationship with her husband seemed to change. She was no longer his little student. She was a full-fledged professional with an advanced degree—more advanced than his master’s degree. At this point the put-downs began, and the lack of communication, and his lateness in coming home from work. He began an affair with another woman, who, not surprisingly, had never gone to college.<br class="calibre4"/>只要她还是个学生，她和罗杰的关系似乎就很好。他为自己的“小学生”感到骄傲，他真的帮了孩子们很大的忙。多年后，当她最终把博士学位挂在墙上时，她和丈夫的关系似乎发生了变化。她不再是他的小学生了。她已经是一个拥有高级学位的专业人士，比他的硕士学位还要高级。在这一点上，他开始受到贬低，缺乏沟通，下班回家迟到。他开始和另一个女人有了外遇，毫不奇怪，这个女人从来没上过大学。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Roger was not able to handle Sheila’s tremendous growth as a human being, and she ended the relationship. It was painful in the beginning—they had been together twelve years—but she began to experience the joy of discovering her own capabilities. She has never regretted her choice to go back to school and create a thriving career.<br class="calibre4"/>罗杰无法承受希拉作为一个人的巨大成长，于是她结束了这段关系。刚开始的时候很痛苦——他们在一起已经12年了——但是她开始体验到发现自己能力的快乐。她从来没有后悔自己选择回到学校，创造了一个蒸蒸日上的事业。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Her daughters, upset in the beginning, are now very proud of her enormous success. She serves as an excellent role model for them. She is now married to a man who absolutely adores the fact she is “out there” doing so well. Her aliveness brightens their life, and he loves her for being such an interesting person. He obviously does not feel threatened by her continuing growth.<br class="calibre4"/>她的女儿们一开始心烦意乱，现在为她的巨大成功感到非常自豪。她为她们树立了一个很好的榜样。她现在嫁给了一个男人，这个男人非常喜欢她在“外面”做得这么好这个事实。她的活力照亮了他们的生活，他爱她，因为她是一个如此有趣的人。他显然不会因为她的不断成长而感到威胁。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">I know your relationship with your mate is not something to be taken lightly, and it often takes a tremendous amount of courage to risk rocking the boat. It is always a risk, but one I believe to be worth taking. When you choose to remain “stuck” simply because you don’t want to upset your mate, you become resentful of the fact that you have not had your chance to grow. Ultimately, the relationship becomes very strained, and it is not unusual for its breakdown to occur anyway. <br class="calibre4"/>我知道你和你的伴侣的关系不是一件容易被轻视的事情，而且经常需要极大的勇气去冒险去破坏这条船。这总是一种冒险，但我认为值得一试。当你仅仅因为不想让你的伴侣不高兴而选择停滞不前时，你就会对自己没有机会成长感到愤怒。最终，你们的关系会变得非常紧张，无论如何，破裂并不罕见。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">My suggestion is:<br class="calibre4"/>我的建议是:</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">BELIEVE THAT YOUR MATE WANTS WHAT IS BEST FOR YOU </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
相信你的伴侣是为了你好
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">AND THAT HE OR SHE WILL ULTIMATELY LOVE </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
他或她最终会爱上
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">THE POSITIVE CHANGES IN YOU.</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
你身上的积极变化。
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">Most probably, your mate will be relieved by your newfound power—it takes some of the responsibility off him or her. Most of us would like to know that the people in our lives are strong and healthy and loving, instead of needy, weak, and helpless. Consider this: If your mate turns out to be someone who really prefers you to be needy, weak, and helpless, do you really want to be there?<br class="calibre4"/>最有可能的是，你的伴侣会因为你新获得的力量而松一口气——这会减轻他或她的一些责任。我们大多数人都想知道我们生活中的人是强壮、健康和有爱心的，而不是贫穷、脆弱和无助的。考虑一下这个问题: 如果你的伴侣真的喜欢你贫穷、软弱和无助，你真的想在他身边吗？</p>
<p class="calibre9">Not only mates have a difficult time when we become alive with possibility. Other family members do, too. Children may become pouty, and parents may become judgmental. They, too, may have become accustomed to relating to us in a certain way, and resist our changing.<br class="calibre4"/>当我们变得充满可能性的时候，不仅仅是伴侣会有困难的时候。其他家庭成员也是如此。孩子可能会撅嘴，父母可能会评头论足。他们也可能已经习惯于以某种方式与我们相处，并且抵制我们的改变。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The masters of manipulation are children, and believe me when I tell you they will often prey upon our tendency to feel guilty. Parents have their own style. Usually their put-downs are subtle and “sweet,” such as, “Darling, are you sure you can do it? You’ve never been much good at doing things on your own, you know?” or “Darling, you’d better rethink getting a divorce. Nobody wants a woman over thirty, especially with two kids” or “You’re acting so selfish lately, I hardly recognize you.”<br class="calibre4"/>操纵的主人是孩子，相信我，他们经常会利用我们感到内疚的倾向。父母有他们自己的风格。通常他们的贬低是微妙的和“甜蜜的”，例如，“亲爱的，你确定你能做到吗？你从来都不擅长自己做事，你知道吗?”或者“亲爱的，你最好重新考虑一下离婚。没人想要一个三十多岁的女人，尤其是有两个孩子的女人”或者“你最近表现得太自私了，我都快认不出你了。”</p>
<p class="calibre9">Very often parents don’t realize that they are undermining their children’s confidence in themselves, and when this is pointed out to them, they stop the criticism. I once told my mother that she obviously had no confidence in me, because she worried about me all the time. She said that was ridiculous, she thought I was the smartest, most competent woman she knew. I pointed out that if that was the case, her worry was unjustified. She looked surprised, and for the first time realized that the way she habitually spoke to me was a carryover from when I was two, and was not based on today’s reality. From this conversation a miracle happened: She became one of my biggest confidence builders. “You can do it. You can do anything you set your mind to do!” Yes, that’s really the way she began speaking to me.<br class="calibre4"/>父母往往没有意识到他们正在削弱孩子对自己的信心，当这一点被指出时，他们就会停止批评。我曾经告诉我的母亲，她显然对我没有信心，因为她总是担心我。她说这太荒谬了，她认为我是她认识的最聪明，最有能力的女人。我指出，如果是这样的话，她的担心是没有道理的。她看起来很惊讶，并且第一次意识到她习惯于对我说话的方式是我两岁时的遗留问题，而不是基于今天的现实。从这次谈话中，奇迹发生了: 她成为了我最大的信心建立者之一。你可以做到的。你可以做任何你下定决心要做的事!”是的，这就是她开始对我说话的方式。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Some may be blessed with a family that is supportive of anything they do, but this is not always the case. Often a great deal of possessiveness is felt by family members, and with that comes a tremendous amount of manipulation. It is important that we learn techniques to create a win-win situation for all parties concerned. This is easier said than done. Behavior change is difficult enough without having to deal with the “crazy” behavior of the people closest to us.<br class="calibre4"/>有些人可能幸运地拥有一个支持他们所做任何事情的家庭，但事实并非总是如此。通常情况下，家庭成员会感受到大量的占有欲，随之而来的是大量的操纵。重要的是，我们要学会为所有相关方创造双赢局面的技巧。说起来容易做起来难。改变行为已经够困难的了，不需要处理我们最亲近的人的“疯狂”行为。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Again, I speak from experience. When I went back to college, it seemed that everyone was upset—my mother, my then-husband, my children, and my friends. My mother couldn’t understand how I could “leave” my children; my husband resented the fact that I had a life apart from him; my children laid a guilt trip on me when I wasn’t there to administer to their every need; and my friends, who were then all housewives and mothers, sided with all of the above!<br class="calibre4"/>再一次，我说的是经验之谈。当我回到大学，似乎每个人都很沮丧——我的母亲，我当时的丈夫，我的孩子，还有我的朋友。我的母亲无法理解我怎么能“离开”我的孩子们; 我的丈夫对我与他分离的生活感到愤怒; 我的孩子们在我不能满足他们所有需求的时候给我带来了负罪感; 我的朋友们当时都是家庭主妇和母亲，他们站在以上所有的一边！</p>
<p class="calibre9">To say that this made me feel insecure about my decision would be an understatement. My reaction was to lash out at anyone who was giving me any difficulty. It was a period of great turmoil. At the time, I was not mature enough to understand why they were upset and to react appropriately. In fact, my inappropriateness was supercharged. I was often really obnoxious. I was acting out what I have subsequently called the PENDULUM SYNDROME, which is illustrated on the following page.<br class="calibre4"/>如果说这让我对自己的决定感到不安，那就太轻描淡写了。我的反应是猛烈抨击任何给我带来困难的人。那是一个非常混乱的时期。那时，我还不够成熟，不能理解他们为什么不安，也不能做出适当的反应。事实上，我的不当行为被强化了。我经常让人讨厌。我在表演我后来称之为“钟摆综合症”的东西，这在下面的页面中有说明。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As we strive for healthy assertiveness in life, we overshoot the mark in the beginning and swing from Passivity to Aggression many times before we settle into Healthy. More accurately, this swing could be called the PASSIVE-TO-OBNOXIOUS-TO-HEALTHY SYNDROME.<br class="calibre4"/>当我们努力在生活中保持健康的自信时，我们在一开始就超越了标准，在我们进入健康状态之前，我们多次从被动转向攻击。更准确地说，这种转变可以被称为被动到讨厌到健康的综合症。</p>
<div class="centeredimage"><div class="calibre4"><img alt="11passaggr.jpg" id="img12" src="image/11passaggr.jpg" class="calibre19"/></div></div>
<p class="noindent">The obnoxious stage can be recognized in the following statements, which are rather mild versions of what came out of my mouth when I was in the throes of the Pendulum Syndrome:<br class="calibre4"/>这个令人讨厌的阶段可以从以下陈述中看出来，这些陈述是我在“钟摆综合症”(Pendulum Syndrome)的阵痛中说出的话的温和版本:</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">“How dare you!”<br class="calibre4"/>“你好大的胆子!”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“I don’t give a damn what you think. I’m doing whatever<br class="calibre4"/>”我才不管你怎么想，我什么都做</p>
<p class="calibre9">I please!”<br class="calibre4"/>我求你了!”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“I don’t need you. I never did!”<br class="calibre4"/>”我不需要你，我从来都不需要!”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“You’re calling <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">me</em> selfish? What about you?”<br class="calibre4"/>“你说我自私? 那你呢?”</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">Although most of us don’t like ourselves when we lash out in such a manner, doing it somehow feels better than reverting to the passive “wimp” we used to be. It is often an understandable part of the process of change. We are not yet sure of ourselves, and our reaction is to defend with all our might.<br class="calibre4"/>尽管我们中的大多数人都不喜欢自己以这种方式发泄情绪，但这样做总比回到过去那种被动的“懦夫”状态要好。这通常是改变过程中可以理解的一部分。我们对自己还不确定，我们的反应是尽全力保卫自己。</p>
<p class="calibre9">This swing to Aggression occurs as we hang on to our new behavior for dear life, afraid of reverting to Passivity once again. Yet every once in a while we get scared and do swing back again to a safe place. Hence, the pendulum swings back and forth as we learn the new language of Healthy Assertiveness. We go from Passivity to Aggression many times before we settle into an appropriate range. Ultimately, we do become more comfortable in expressing our needs and doing what we have to do in this world, and we settle down in the appropriate range. But in the beginning, this Pendulum Syndrome is a reality, and it causes much confusion and discomfort, not only for us, but for everyone around us.<br class="calibre4"/>当我们为了珍贵的生命坚持我们的新行为，害怕再次回到被动的时候，这种攻击性的摇摆就发生了。然而，每隔一段时间，我们就会感到害怕，并再次回到一个安全的地方。因此，当我们学习健康自信的新语言时，钟摆会来回摆动。在我们进入一个合适的范围之前，我们会多次从被动转向攻击。最终，我们在表达我们的需求和做我们在这个世界上必须做的事情时会变得更加舒适，我们在适当的范围内安顿下来。但是在一开始，这种钟摆综合症是一个现实，它造成了很多困惑和不适，不仅对我们，而且对我们周围的每个人。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Although our behavior is often inappropriate, it is important not to punish ourselves for it. Interestingly, we allow children the leeway they need to test new ways of relating to the world, yet we are hard on ourselves when going through the same process. In reality, we go through fearful new behavioral stages throughout our entire lives, and as we do we are constantly floundering around, until we learn how to do it right.<br class="calibre4"/>尽管我们的行为常常是不恰当的，但重要的是不要因此而惩罚自己。有趣的是，我们允许孩子们有足够的余地去尝试与世界联系的新方式，然而当我们经历同样的过程时，我们对自己很苛刻。事实上，在我们的一生中，我们都会经历可怕的新的行为阶段，而当我们这样做的时候，我们就会不断地挣扎，直到我们学会如何正确地去做。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Again, AWARENESS is the key. Know that in all likelihood, as you start to take risks and grow, you are going to get resistance from people in your life. It’s a given. If it isn’t your mate, it will be your parents or your children or your friends. When you rock the boat, someone will tell you to sit down. You need not feel shocked, surprised, or self-righteous. It is their way of defending their security. Often they don’t even know they are doing it. In their minds, these admonitions and observations seem totally justified and “for your own good.” What is important is that <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">you</em> know what is happening.<br class="calibre4"/>再次强调，意识是关键。要知道，很有可能，当你开始冒险和成长的时候，你会遇到来自生活中其他人的阻力。这是必然的。如果它不是你的伴侣，它将是你的父母或你的孩子或你的朋友。当你在船上捣乱时，有人会让你坐下。你不必感到震惊、惊讶或自以为是。这是他们保护自己安全的方式。通常他们甚至不知道自己在做什么。在他们看来，这些警告和观察似乎是完全合理的，“为了你自己的利益”重要的是你知道发生了什么。</p>
<p class="calibre9">It will also help if you acknowledge others when they are supporting you. Let them feel good when they are acting in a nurturing way. Send them a loving note expressing your appreciation or some flowers or balloons or whatever will make them happy. This will reinforce the kind of reactions from them that you are seeking and will help <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">you</em> focus on their contribution rather than their negativity.<br class="calibre4"/>当别人支持你的时候，如果你对他们表示感谢，也会有所帮助。让他们感觉良好，当他们以一种养育的方式行事。送给他们一张充满爱意的便条，表达你的感激之情，或者送他们一些鲜花、气球，或者其他任何能让他们开心的东西。这将加强他们对你的反应，帮助你关注他们的贡献，而不是他们的消极。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Your awareness of the Pendulum Syndrome should enable you to bypass some of the swings and handle put-downs more appropriately. There are win-win ways of stopping negative feedback from others. You can learn to respond to significant others in a way that does not demolish them. Here are some examples:<br class="calibre4"/>你对钟摆综合症的意识应该能够让你避开一些波动，更恰当地处理贬低。有一些双赢的方法可以阻止他人的负面反馈。你可以学会以一种不会摧毁他人的方式回应重要的他人。下面是一些例子:</p>
<p class="spaceabove2"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Mom:</em> “You’ll never make it out there on your own.”<br class="calibre4"/>妈妈: “你一个人是不可能成功的。”</p>
<p class="doubleindent"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Lose-Lose:</em> “Mind your own business. I’ll do as I please!”<br class="calibre4"/>失去-失去: “管好你自己的事，我想做什么就做什么!”</p>
<p class="doubleindent"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Win-Win:</em> “Thank you for your concern, Mom, but I have so much faith in myself, I know that whatever comes up, I’ll handle it. I’d like you to have more faith in me too. It would really help me a lot.”<br class="calibre4"/>双赢: “谢谢你的关心，妈妈，但是我对自己充满信心，我知道无论发生什么，我都会处理好的。我希望你也能对我有更多的信心。这对我真的很有帮助。”</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">The win-win answer is clear. It states your confidence in yourself (act as if, even if you’re not quite sure you <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">will</em> make it on your own) and lets her know what you would like from her.<br class="calibre4"/>双赢的答案显而易见。它表明了你对自己的信心(即使你不确定自己能否做到) ，让她知道你想从她那里得到什么。</p>
<p class="doubleindent"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Husband:</em> “Look at yourself. You’ve become so selfish since you started that job. Do you really like yourself that way?”<br class="calibre4"/>丈夫: “看看你自己。自从你开始那份工作以来，你变得那么自私。你真的那样喜欢自己吗?”</p>
<p class="doubleindent"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Lose-Lose:</em> “You call <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">me</em> selfish. Who do you think has been picking up after you all these years? Now it’s <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">my</em> turn.”<br class="calibre4"/>失败-失败: “你说我自私。你认为这些年来谁一直在勾引你？现在轮到我了。”</p>
<p class="doubleindent"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Win-Win:</em> “I can see why you think I’m being selfish— I’m not available to you as much as I used to be. All this change is difficult for me as well, but I need to do this for my own growth. If I don’t, I know I will hold an awful lot of resentment toward myself and toward you. I really would like to have your support. I know you’re feeling a little neglected right now, and it’s only natural. I want you to know that I love you very much. What can we do to improve the situation?”<br class="calibre4"/>双赢: “我知道你为什么认为我很自私ーー我不再像以前那样能为你所用了。所有这些改变对我来说都是困难的，但是我需要这样做是为了我自己的成长。如果我不这样做，我知道我会对自己和你怀有极大的怨恨。我真的很想得到你的支持。我知道你现在觉得自己被忽视了，这很正常。我想让你知道我非常爱你。我们能做些什么来改善这种情况?”</p>
<p class="spaceabove2"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Children:</em> “You don’t care about us anymore.”<br class="calibre4"/>孩子们: “你们不再关心我们了。”</p>
<p class="doubleindent"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Lose-Lose:</em> “You kids have absolutely no appreciation. I’ve been your slave ever since you were born. Now I do something for myself, and you’re complaining!”<br class="calibre4"/>“你们这些孩子一点都不懂得欣赏。从你们出生起，我就是你们的奴隶。现在我为自己做了一些事情，你却在抱怨!”</p>
<p class="doubleindent"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Win-Win:</em> “I know it feels different because I’m not around all the time. But I really trust that you guys will find a way to be without me for these few hours. Parents are people too. And it’s important for my peace of mind to be able to work.”<br class="calibre4"/>双赢: “我知道这感觉不一样，因为我不是一直在你身边。但是我真的相信你们会找到办法在这几个小时里不和我在一起。父母也是人。能够工作对我内心的平静很重要。”</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">The dialogue will not always end there, but that is the tenor of a win-win interaction. An excellent book on the subject of nonaggressive self-defense is <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Aikido in Everyday Life</em> by Terry Dobson and Victor Miller. Their premise is that “the best victory is the one in which everyone wins.” It describes a gentle way to win and gives many sample dialogues and reasons why they work.<br class="calibre4"/>对话不会总是到此为止，但这是双赢互动的基调。Terry Dobson 和 Victor Miller 的《日常生活中的合气道》(Aikido in Everyday Life)是一本关于非侵略性自卫主题的优秀书籍。他们的前提是“最好的胜利是每个人都获得的胜利。”它描述了一种温和的获胜方式，并给出了许多例子对话和为什么他们工作的原因。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I suggest you also learn some centering techniques, so that when you feel yourself swing over to one extreme or the other you can bring yourself back to a place of balance and harmony. Also relaxation audios, meditation, and positive affirmations as described in the last chapter are a few ways to get yourself to a more peaceful place. Later chapters will offer more tools to gain self-control, so you can have what you want without hurting someone else in the process.<br class="calibre4"/>我建议你也学习一些集中注意力的技巧，这样当你感到自己摇摆到一个极端或另一个极端的时候，你可以把自己带回到一个平衡和和谐的地方。此外，放松音频、冥想和上一章所描述的积极肯定也是让自己进入一个更加平静的地方的一些方法。后面的章节将提供更多的工具来获得自我控制，这样你就可以在不伤害其他人的情况下得到你想要的。</p>
<p class="calibre9">It will greatly help your understanding to know that one of the reasons we react so hostilely when others don’t support us is our <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">need for approval.</em> Whenever we get upset at the comments of loved ones, it is a clue we are still acting like a child. Guilt is another clue. Guilt and hostility often mask our anger at ourselves and others for our not being able to break unhealthy ties with loved ones. The lashing-out part of the Pendulum Syndrome comes from this unhealthy attachment.<br class="calibre4"/>当别人不支持我们的时候，我们反应如此敌对的原因之一就是我们需要别人的认可，这将极大地帮助你理解这一点。每当我们对所爱的人的评论感到沮丧时，这是一个线索，表明我们仍然表现得像个孩子。内疚是另一个线索。内疚和敌意常常掩盖了我们对自己和他人的愤怒，因为我们无法打破与所爱的人之间不健康的联系。钟摆综合症的攻击部分来自于这种不健康的依恋。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As you become clearer and more adult about what you need to do in order to grow, loved ones will be able to say anything they please and you won’t be affected. You can simply give them a big kiss and say, “I love you but I have to live my own life.” End of story. No moans and groans. No hysteria about how badly they are all treating you. In a sense, your need to please shows you what you have to work on—and that is: letting go emotionally of the role of child and stepping into the role of adult. As difficult as it is, cutting childlike relationships with others and substituting more responsible ones allows you to act much more lovingly toward other people in your life. It is a paradox. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">The less you need someone’s approval, the more you are able to love them.</em><br class="calibre4"/>当你变得越来越清楚，越来越成熟，你需要做什么，以成长，爱的人将能够说任何他们高兴，你不会受到影响。你可以简单地给他们一个大大的吻，然后说: “我爱你，但是我必须过我自己的生活。”故事结束。没有呻吟和呻吟。不再歇斯底里地抱怨他们对你有多糟糕。从某种意义上说，你对取悦的需求向你展示了你必须努力做的事情——也就是: 在情感上放弃孩子的角色，进入成人的角色。尽管这很困难，但是切断与他人的孩子般的关系，代之以更负责任的关系，可以让你对生活中的其他人表现得更有爱心。这是一个悖论。你越不需要别人的认可，你就越能爱他们。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Look at people in your life as “practice.” The way you react to them allows you to see what you have to work on within yourself. Through them you can practice letting go of inappropriate reactions and developing more responsible ways of behaving. So, instead of wanting to throttle your loved ones when they give you a hard time, it is better to look at them as mirrors of what you still need to work on in terms of your personal growth.<br class="calibre4"/>把你生活中的人看作是“练习”你对他们的反应可以让你看到你需要在自己身上做些什么。通过他们，你可以练习放下不适当的反应，培养更负责任的行为方式。所以，与其在你所爱的人给你难堪的时候想掐死他们，不如把他们看作是你个人成长过程中仍然需要努力的一面镜子。</p>
<p class="calibre9">If you cannot reason with loved ones about their destructive behavior toward you, it is best to create some distance until you learn to operate on a more adult level. The father of one of my students, Charlotte, actually used to tell her point-blank that, without a doubt, she was incompetent. No beating around the bush on his part! Eventually, she was able to say to him, “You know, Dad, I love you very much, and until you start respecting who I am, I am going to stay away from you. Right now I need people to support me and love me, and that’s not what I feel coming from you.” She stayed away from him, making only perfunctory holiday calls, until she felt enough inner strength to handle his put-downs. This was not easy. Saying good-bye to the old relationship with a parent usually requires that we go through grief until the old door is closed and the new one is opened. We are, in effect, grieving for the end of an era. The emerging era, however, brings much more satisfaction with it. Much to Charlotte’s surprise, when she finally reconnected with her father, the put-downs stopped.<br class="calibre4"/>如果你不能和你所爱的人就他们对你的破坏性行为进行理论分析，那么你最好与他们保持一定的距离，直到你学会在一个更成熟的层面上进行操作。我的一个学生的父亲，夏洛特，曾经直截了当地告诉她，毫无疑问，她是无能的。他可没有拐弯抹角！最后，她终于能够对他说，“你知道，爸爸，我非常爱你，在你开始尊重我之前，我会离你远远的。现在我需要人们支持我，爱我，这不是我从你身上感受到的。”她远离他，只是敷衍了事地打假日电话，直到她感觉到足够的内在力量来应付他的贬低。这并不容易。与父母的旧关系说再见通常需要我们经历悲伤，直到旧的门关闭，新的门打开。实际上，我们是在为一个时代的结束而悲伤。然而，新兴时代带来了更多的满足感。让夏洛特感到惊讶的是，当她最终和父亲重新取得联系的时候，这种贬低停止了。</p>
<p class="calibre9">In all likelihood, prior to her newfound growth, she did present to her father a full-blown picture of incompetence. When that changed, so did his reaction to her. Usually inner strength is respected—we get back what we put out.<br class="calibre4"/>很有可能，在她新长大之前，她确实向她父亲展示了一幅完全不称职的画面。当这种情况发生改变时，父亲对她的反应也随之改变。通常内心的力量是受到尊重的——我们付出什么就会得到什么。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The most important thing is for you to be your own best friend. Whatever you are doing—don’t put yourself down. Slowly begin to discover which, for you, is the path of the heart. Which path in life will make you grow? That is the path to take. You might be surprised when your loved ones ultimately come to understand and respect that. If not, your new strength will allow you to break unhealthy ties and establish new, healthier ones.<br class="calibre4"/>对你来说，最重要的是成为你自己最好的朋友。不管你在做什么——不要贬低自己。慢慢地开始发现，对你来说，哪条路才是心之所向。生活中哪条路会让你成长？这就是你要走的路。当你所爱的人最终理解并尊重这一点时，你可能会感到惊讶。如果不是，你的新力量将允许你打破不健康的关系，建立新的，更健康的关系。</p>
