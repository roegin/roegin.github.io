<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="drop">O</span>ne of the biggest fears that keeps us from moving ahead with our lives is our difficulty in making decisions. As one of my students lamented, “Sometimes I feel like the proverbial donkey between two bales of hay—unable to decide which one I want, and, in the meantime, starving to death.” The irony, of course, is that by not choosing, we <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">are</em> choosing—to starve. We are choosing to deprive ourselves of what makes life a delicious feast.<br class="calibre4"/>阻碍我们继续生活的最大恐惧之一就是我们做决定的困难。正如我的一个学生哀叹的那样: “有时候我觉得自己就像一头夹在两捆干草中间的驴子——无法决定自己想要哪一捆，与此同时，我快饿死了。”当然，具有讽刺意味的是，我们没有选择，就是在选择挨饿。我们选择剥夺我们自己的生活是一场美味的盛宴。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The problem is that we have been taught “Be careful! You might make the wrong decision!” A <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">wrong</em> decision! Just the sound of that can bring terror to our hearts. We are afraid that the wrong decision will deprive us of something—money, friends, lovers, status, or whatever the <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">right</em> decision is supposed to bring us.<br class="calibre4"/>问题是，我们被教导“要小心！你可能会做出错误的决定!”错误的决定！只要听到这个声音，我们的心就会感到恐惧。我们害怕错误的决定会使我们失去一些东西——金钱、朋友、情人、地位，或者任何正确的决定应该带给我们的东西。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Closely tied to this is our panic over making mistakes. For some reason we feel we should be perfect, and forget that we <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">learn</em> through our mistakes. Our need to be perfect and our need to control the outcome of events work together to keep us petrified when we think about making a change or attempting a new challenge.<br class="calibre4"/>与此密切相关的是我们对犯错误的恐慌。出于某种原因，我们认为我们应该是完美的，而忘记了我们从错误中学习。我们需要变得完美，我们需要控制事件的结果，当我们想要做出改变或者尝试一个新的挑战时，这两种需求一起使我们变得僵化。</p>
<p class="calibre9">If the above describes you, I am going to demonstrate that you are worrying needlessly. There really is nothing to lose, only something to gain, whatever the choices you make or actions you take in life. As I stated earlier, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">all you have to do to change your world is change the way you think about it.</em> This concept works beautifully here. You can actually shift your thinking in such a way as to make a wrong decision or mistake an <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">impossibility.</em> Let’s begin with decision making.<br class="calibre4"/>如果以上描述的就是你，那么我将证明你的担心是多余的。真的没有什么可以失去的，只有可以得到的，无论你在生活中做出什么样的选择或采取什么样的行动。正如我之前所说，要改变你的世界，你所要做的就是改变你思考世界的方式。这个概念在这里非常有效。你实际上可以改变你的思维方式，以至于做出一个错误的决定或错误的不可能。让我们从做决定开始。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Suppose you are at a Choice Point in life. If you are like most of us, you have been taught to use the No-Win Model as you think about the decision to be made. The model looks like this:<br class="calibre4"/>假设你正处于人生的一个抉择时刻。如果你和我们大多数人一样，在思考要做的决定时，你被教导要使用“没有赢的模式”。这个模型是这样的:</p>
<div class="centeredimage"><div class="calibre4"><img alt="13nowin.jpg" id="img14" src="image/13nowin.jpg" class="calibre20"/></div></div>
<p class="noindent">Your heart feels heavy about the choice you have to make. You feel somewhat paralyzed as you think about the consequences in life-and-death terms. You stand at the threshold of the decision, lamenting and obsessing: “Should I do this or should I do that? What if I go this way and that happens? What if it doesn’t work out the way I plan? What if . . . ” The “what if”s are out in full force. The internal Chatterbox is at it again. You look at the unknown and try to predict the future; you try to take control of outside forces. Both are impossible. At this point you might notice that you are driving yourself crazy.<br class="calibre4"/>你的心为你必须做出的选择而感到沉重。当你想到生死攸关的后果时，你会感到有些麻木。你站在决定的门槛上，悲叹着，纠结着: “我应该这样做还是那样做？如果我走这条路，而那条路发生了怎么办？如果事情没有按照我的计划发展呢？如果... ...”“如果”已经全面展开了。内部话匣子又开始了。你看着未知，试图预测未来; 你试图控制外部力量。两者都是不可能的。在这一点上，你可能会注意到你正在把自己逼疯。</p>
<p class="calibre9">After the decision is made, the No-Win Model makes you constantly reassess the situation, hoping you didn’t make a mistake. You keep looking back and berating yourself with “If only I had . . . ” You waste valuable energy, and you also make yourself miserable.<br class="calibre4"/>在做出决定后，没有赢的模式会让你不断地重新评估情况，希望你没有犯错误。你不断地回顾并责备自己“要是我有... ... 就好了。”你浪费了宝贵的精力，同时也让自己痛苦不堪。</p>
<p class="calibre9">You gain relief if the outcome is as you hoped it would be— but only temporarily. As you breathe a sigh of relief, you are already worrying that the situation might reverse itself and that it might <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">ultimately</em> prove to be the wrong decision. Furthermore, you are already fearful about the next decision you have to make, because you will have to go through the whole agonizing process once again. Look familiar? Crazy, isn’t it! Clearly, this is a no-win situation. But there is another way—the No-Lose Model.<br class="calibre4"/>如果结果如你所愿，你会得到解脱——但只是暂时的。当你松了一口气的时候，你已经开始担心情况可能会逆转，最终可能被证明是错误的决定。此外，你已经对下一个决定感到恐惧，因为你将不得不再次经历整个痛苦的过程。看起来眼熟吗？很疯狂，不是吗！很明显，这是个双输的局面。但是还有另外一种方式——不输的模式。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Go back and stand at the Choice Point again. This time, the situation looks like this:<br class="calibre4"/>回到选择点，这次的情况是这样的:</p>
<div class="centeredimage"><div class="calibre4"><img alt="14nolose.jpg" id="img15" src="image/14nolose.jpg" class="calibre20"/></div></div>
<p class="noindent">Notice that what lies ahead are simply two paths—A and B<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">—both of which are right</em>! Each path has nothing but “goodies” along the way. You are clearly facing a no-lose situation. And what are these goodies? They are opportunities to experience life in a new way, to learn and grow, to find out who you are and who you would really like to be and what you would like to do in this life. Each path is strewn with opportunities<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">— despite the outcome.</em> “What? <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Despite the outcome?</em>” Up to this point you may have been willing to go along with me, but those three words are making you a little dubious, if not downright resistant. “What if . . . ” comes up again in your thinking. Let me answer your “what if”s with an example.<br class="calibre4"/>注意前方只有两条路径—— a 和 b ——它们都是正确的！每条路径沿途除了“好东西”什么都没有。很明显，你正面临着一个不会失败的局面。这些好东西是什么？它们是以一种新的方式体验生活的机会，学习和成长，找出你是谁，你真正想成为谁，你在这一生中想做什么。不管结果如何，每条道路都充满了机遇。什么？不顾后果?”到目前为止，你可能愿意和我一起去，但这三个字让你有点怀疑，如果不是彻头彻尾的抵制。“如果... ...”又出现在你的思维中。让我用一个例子来回答你的“如果”。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Imagine you are faced with the choice of staying with your present job or taking a new one that has opened up for you. If you stand at the No-Win Choice Point, your Chatterbox takes over and craziness begins:<br class="calibre4"/>想象一下，你面临的选择是继续现在的工作，还是选择一份为你开辟的新工作。如果你站在没有双赢的选择点，你的话匣子接管了，疯狂开始了:</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">“If I stay here I might be missing a very good chance to move ahead. But if I go, maybe I won’t be able to handle my new responsibilities. What if I get fired on the new job, and then I have nothing? I really like it here. I’ll have more opportunity to move ahead on the new job. Maybe they’ll promote me and I’ll be making more money. But what if I regret leaving? What if . . . ? Oh, I don’t know what to do! I could ruin my whole life if I make the wrong decision!”<br class="calibre4"/>“如果我留在这里，我可能会错过一个很好的向前发展的机会。但是如果我走了，也许我就不能承担我的新责任了。如果我因为新工作被解雇，然后一无所有怎么办？我真的喜欢这里。我将有更多的机会在新的工作上向前迈进。也许他们会提拔我，我会赚更多的钱。但如果我后悔离开呢？如果... ？哦，我不知道该怎么办！如果我做了错误的决定，我可能会毁了我的一生!”</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">If you stand at the No-Lose Choice Point, your “fearless” self takes over:<br class="calibre4"/>如果你站在不输的选择点上，你的“无畏”自我就会接管:</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">“Isn’t it fantastic! I’ve been offered a new job. If I take it, I’ll have an opportunity to meet new people, to learn new ways of doing things, to experience an entirely different work atmosphere and to broaden my base of experience. If something happens and it doesn’t work out, I know I’ll handle it. Even though the job market is difficult right now, I know somehow I’ll find another job if I need one. Even that will be an interesting experience, since I’ll learn to deal with the loss of a job and learn to solve the problems that might come up if I am unemployed. If I stay, I have an opportunity to deepen the contacts I have made here. I really feel better about myself having been offered the other job, so if I stay, perhaps I’ll ask for a promotion. If for some reason it doesn’t work out here, there will be other opportunities to pursue. It’s all an adventure, no matter which way I turn.”<br class="calibre4"/>这不是很棒吗！我得到了一份新工作。如果我接受这份工作，我将有机会认识新的人，学习新的做事方法，体验完全不同的工作氛围，拓宽我的经验基础。如果发生了什么事情，但是没有成功，我知道我会处理好的。尽管现在就业市场很困难，但我知道如果我需要的话，我会找到另一份工作。即便如此，这也将是一次有趣的经历，因为我将学会处理失业问题，学会解决失业后可能出现的问题。如果我留下来，我就有机会加深我在这里建立的联系。我真的对自己得到另一份工作感觉好多了，所以如果我留下来，也许我会要求升职。如果出于某种原因这份工作没有成功，我会有其他的机会去追求。不管我走哪条路，这都是一次冒险。”</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">I really do know people who think this way—and their approach to life is a joy to be around. They truly live in a no-lose world.<br class="calibre4"/>我真的认识这样想的人，他们的生活方式是一种乐趣。他们真的生活在一个没有损失的世界里。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Alex is a perfect example. Now a practicing psychologist in Los Angeles, he originally intended to follow in his father’s footsteps and become a lawyer. His college grades were excellent, and he had no trouble getting into what was considered a fine law school. He studied hard and did very well the first two years. But the time spent away from home began making a difference in his personal priorities. He came to realize that he didn’t want to spend the rest of his life in the “combat zone,” as he called it, that being a lawyer required. He wanted to help people in a different way, and he decided that clinical psychology was much more in line with his personality. He also realized that part of his decision to be a lawyer was his desire to please his father. But now he was much more in touch with the person inside himself, and he made the decision to leave law school and pursue a career in psychology. His father gave him his blessing but refused to pay any more of his college expenses, thus increasing the difficulty of the decision. But Alex trusted his gut and withdrew from a situation that did not suit his needs.<br class="calibre4"/>亚历克斯就是一个很好的例子。现在他是洛杉矶的一名执业心理学家，他原本打算追随父亲的脚步，成为一名律师。他的大学成绩优异，他毫不费力地进入了一所被认为是很好的法学院。他学习很努力，头两年表现很好。但是离开家的时间开始改变他个人的优先考虑。他开始意识到，他不想在他称之为“战区”的地方度过余生，而这正是成为一名律师所必须的。他想以不同的方式帮助别人，他认为临床心理学更符合他的个性。他也意识到，他决定成为一名律师的部分原因是他想取悦他的父亲。但是现在他更加了解自己的内心，他决定离开法学院，从事心理学的职业。他的父亲给了他祝福，但拒绝支付更多的大学费用，从而增加了决定的难度。但是亚历克斯相信他的直觉，退出了一个不符合他需要的环境。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Some, including his father, saw those two years at law school as a waste of time, but Alex never saw it that way. By trying it out, he discovered that being a lawyer was not for him. Finding out what you <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">don’t</em> like is, paradoxically, as valuable as finding out what you do like. Also, while at law school he made a number of good friends, who remain his friends today. And the information he gathered from those first two years has helped him in many personal and professional situations since.<br class="calibre4"/>一些人，包括他的父亲，认为在法学院的两年是浪费时间，但亚历克斯从来不这样认为。通过尝试，他发现成为一名律师并不适合他。自相矛盾的是，发现自己不喜欢什么和发现自己喜欢什么一样重要。还有，在法学院的时候，他交了很多好朋友，现在仍然是他的朋友。从那以后，他从头两年收集到的信息在许多个人和职业生涯中都有所帮助。</p>
<p class="calibre9">For Alex, the goodies didn’t end there. Since his father had stopped paying his expenses, he had to work for two years to obtain enough money to get started on his degree in psychology. Were those two years wasted? Not at all. His job with a construction company was doubly enriching: he was exposed to a different way of life, and, through one of his co-workers, he met the woman who became his wife. Finally, with a fellowship and his two part-time jobs, Alex was able to complete his doctorate.<br class="calibre4"/>对于亚历克斯来说，好东西并没有到此为止。因为他的父亲已经停止支付他的费用，他不得不工作两年来获得足够的钱开始他的心理学学位。这两年是不是浪费了？完全没有。他在一家建筑公司的工作使他受益匪浅: 他接触到了一种不同的生活方式，通过一名同事，他遇到了后来成为他妻子的女人。最后，通过奖学金和两份兼职工作，亚历克斯终于完成了他的博士学位。</p>
<p class="calibre9">This set of events was invaluable in terms of teaching Alex to take responsibility for his own life. Perhaps neither he nor his father realized it at the time, but his father really did him a favor by making him stand on his own two feet. Alex learned that if you want something badly enough, there is a way to get it. And if there was a way, he would find it. He knew that if he hadn’t been able to obtain a fellowship, he would have found another way. As a result, he approached future decisions with a feeling of power, energy, and excitement. Remember that underlying all our fears is <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">a lack of trust in ourselves.</em> Each step that Alex took, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">despite the outcome</em>, even when it meant loss of financial support and delay in his education, was an opportunity for him to learn to trust himself to provide for his own needs.<br class="calibre4"/>这一系列事件对于教会亚历克斯为自己的生活负责是非常宝贵的。也许他和他的父亲当时都没有意识到这一点，但是他的父亲真的帮了他一个大忙，让他能够自力更生。亚历克斯认识到，如果你非常想得到某样东西，就有办法得到它。如果有办法，他会找到的。他知道，如果自己没有得到奖学金，也会有其他的办法。因此，他以一种充满力量、活力和激动的心情面对未来的抉择。请记住，在我们所有的恐惧之下是对自己缺乏信任。不管结果如何，亚历克斯迈出的每一步，即使意味着失去经济支持和延迟他的教育，都是一个机会，让他学会相信自己能满足自己的需求。</p>
<p class="calibre9">It’s interesting to me that when I present the No-Lose Model to my students, the resistance is initially very high. “Oh, come on, you’re not being realistic.” As I said earlier, we have been taught to believe that negative equals realistic and positive equals unrealistic. When I challenge my students, they can’t find more credence in the No-Win Model than in the No-Lose Model, yet the latter can move us from a position of pain to one of power, which is ultimately our goal as we learn to deal with fear. Another point to consider is that <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">it feels better to come from a no-lose position.</em> Why continue to resist coming from a no-lose position? Why continue to feel pain, paralysis, and depression? Yet we continue to do it until we incorporate into our being another way of seeing the world. Then we can slowly begin to change the no-win thinking that has kept us victimized.<br class="calibre4"/>有趣的是，当我向我的学生展示“不失败”模型时，最初的阻力非常大。“哦，拜托，你太不现实了。”正如我之前所说，我们被教导相信消极就是现实，积极就是不现实。当我向我的学生提出挑战时，他们不会发现“不赢”模式比“不输”模式更值得信任，但后者可以将我们从痛苦的境地转变为有权力的境地，这最终是我们学习应对恐惧时的目标。另一个需要考虑的问题是，来自一个不会失败的位置会让人感觉更好。为什么要继续抵制来自一个没有损失的位置呢？为什么还要继续感受痛苦、瘫痪和抑郁？然而，我们一直在这样做，直到我们融入到我们看世界的另一种方式中。然后我们就可以慢慢地开始改变那种让我们成为受害者的不可能成功的想法。</p>
<p class="calibre9">A critical factor in your accepting the No-Lose Model is the way you think about outcomes and opportunities. It might be hard for you to accept the fact that losing a job is a no-lose situation. Traditionally, opportunities in life are thought of as relating to money, status, and the visible signs of “success.” I’m asking you to think of opportunity in an entirely different light. The purpose of this book is to help you handle fear in a way that allows you to fulfill your goals in life. Every time you encounter something that forces you to “handle it,” your self-esteem is raised considerably. You learn to trust that you will survive, no matter what happens. And in this way your fears are diminished immeasurably.<br class="calibre4"/>你接受无损模型的一个关键因素是你思考结果和机会的方式。你可能很难接受这样一个事实，即失去一份工作是不会失去的。传统上，生活中的机会被认为与金钱、地位和“成功”的明显标志有关我希望你能从一个完全不同的角度来看待机遇。这本书的目的是帮助你处理恐惧的方式，让你实现你的生活目标。每当你遇到迫使你“处理它”的事情时，你的自尊心就会大大提高。你学会相信无论发生什么，你都会生存下来。通过这种方式，你的恐惧会大大减少。</p>

<p class="spaceabove1">Getting back to my earlier example, if the outcome of your choosing to move to a new job is for you to lose that job within a few months, you now see how you will have the opportunity to strengthen your self-esteem by facing the storm, regrouping your inner forces, reaching out once again to find a new, perhaps more satisfying, position. In the meantime, you will be meeting new people and enlarging your world. Seen in this light, losing your job becomes a no-lose situation.<br class="calibre4"/>回到我之前的例子，如果你选择换一份新工作的结果是在几个月内丢掉那份工作，你现在就会看到，你将有机会通过面对风暴、重新组织你的内心力量、再次寻找一个新的、或许更令人满意的职位来增强你的自尊。与此同时，你将会结识新的朋友，拓宽你的世界。从这个角度来看，失去你的工作成为一个不会失去的情况。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I have often said to my students that perhaps the “lucky” ones in life are those who have been forced to face things in their lives that we all hope we will never have to face—things such as losing a job, the death of a loved one, divorce, bankruptcy, illness. Once you have handled any of those things, you emerge a much stronger person. I know of few people who have experienced loss and haven’t felt a large measure of pride in themselves at finding a way to make their lives work despite their adversity. They have discovered that <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">security is not having things; it’s handling things.</em> Thus, when you can answer all your “what if”s with “I can handle it,” you can approach all things with a no-lose guarantee, and the fear disappears.<br class="calibre4"/>我经常对我的学生说，或许生活中的“幸运儿”是那些被迫面对生活中我们都希望永远不必面对的事情的人——比如失业、爱人去世、离婚、破产、疾病。一旦你处理了这些事情，你就会变成一个更加坚强的人。据我所知，很少有人经历过失去，也很少有人对自己在逆境中仍能找到让生活继续下去的方法感到自豪。他们发现安全感不是拥有东西，而是处理事情。因此，当你可以用“我能处理好”来回答你所有的“如果”时，你就可以保证万无一失地处理所有事情，恐惧也就消失了。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Now that you’ve learned that there really are no right or wrong decisions when using the No-Lose Model, there are steps you can take to heighten your awareness of the alternatives that lie before you. This awareness will better improve the chances of the outcome being aligned with your wishes, and will give you greater peace of mind. I suggest that the following steps be taken when you face a major decision and after you’ve made one.<br class="calibre4"/>现在你已经知道在使用无损失模型时没有正确或错误的决定，你可以采取一些步骤来提高你对摆在你面前的其他选择的认识。这种意识将更好地提高结果与你的愿望一致的机会，并将给你更大的内心平静。我建议当你面临一个重大决定并做出决定之后，采取以下步骤。</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">Before Making a Decision</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
在做决定之前
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">1. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Focus immediately on the No-Lose Model.</em> Affirm to yourself, “I can’t lose—regardless of the outcome of the decision I make. The world is a place for opportunity, and I look forward to the opportunities for learning and growing that either pathway gives me.” Push out thoughts of what you can lose and allow only thoughts of what you can gain. Use the exercises in the chapter on positive thinking.<br class="calibre4"/>1.立即将注意力集中在无损模型上。向自己肯定，“我不能输——不管我做出的决定的结果如何。这个世界是一个充满机遇的地方，我期待着学习和成长的机会，无论哪条路都会给我这样的机会。”抛开你会失去什么的想法，只允许你会得到什么的想法。使用积极思考章节中的练习。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">2. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Do your homework.</em> There is much to learn about the alternatives that lie before you. It is most helpful to talk to as many people as will listen. Don’t be afraid to approach professionals relative to the decision to be made. A few might put you off, but most will be happy to help. In fact, they will be flattered that you came to them for advice.<br class="calibre4"/>2.做好你的功课。关于摆在你面前的其他选择，还有很多需要学习。尽可能多的和愿意倾听的人交谈是最有帮助的。不要害怕与专业人士接触，相对于要做的决定。一些人可能会让你犹豫，但是大多数人会很乐意帮助你。事实上，他们会因为你向他们寻求建议而受宠若惊。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Look for feedback from other sources as well. Talk to people at dinner parties, in the barbershop or beauty salon, the doctor’s office, or wherever. People you meet in unlikely places can create a valuable connection for you in ways you never could have imagined, or they might give you an insight learned from their personal experiences.<br class="calibre4"/>也可以从其他来源获得反馈。在晚宴、理发店、美容院、医生办公室或任何地方与人交谈。你在意想不到的地方遇到的人可以以你从未想象过的方式为你创造一种有价值的联系，或者他们可以从他们的个人经历中给你一种洞察力。</p>
<p class="calibre9">It is important that you talk to the “right” people. Let me give you my definition of the right people. They are those who support your learning and growing. If you talk to people who constantly put down the possibilities open to you, they are the wrong people to talk to. Politely say thank you and go on to someone else.<br class="calibre4"/>重要的是，你要和“正确”的人交谈。让我告诉你我对正确的人的定义。他们是那些支持你学习和成长的人。如果你和那些不断向你敞开大门的人交谈，他们就不是你该交谈的对象。礼貌地说声谢谢，然后去找其他人。</p>
<p class="calibre9">One wonderful teacher of mine helped me greatly when he taught me the phrase “First time, shame on you. Second time, shame on me.” Applied to this situation, if you discuss something with people who are insensitive to your needs, shame on them. If you continue to allow yourself to be battered by their words, shame on you. You don’t have to continue having conversations about your decision with those who make you feel bad about yourself. You should talk to people who can support you with statements like “I think it’s terrific you’re considering . . . ” or “I think you’ll do beautifully at . . . ” You get the picture. Why put yourself in a position to feel miserable when it’s so easy to feel great?<br class="calibre4"/>我的一位很棒的老师曾经教过我一句话: “第一次，你真丢脸。第二次，我感到羞耻。”在这种情况下，如果你和那些对你的需求不敏感的人讨论一些事情，那么你要为他们感到羞耻。如果你继续允许自己被他们的话打击，那么你就该感到羞耻。你不必继续和那些让你感觉糟糕的人谈论你的决定。你应该和那些能够支持你的人交谈，比如“我认为你正在考虑... ...”或者“我认为你在... ... 会做得很好”。为什么要把自己放在一个让自己感到痛苦的位置上呢? 当你很容易就能感觉很棒的时候？</p>
<p class="calibre9">Also, don’t hesitate to talk about your plans just because you are fearful that if they don’t work out you’ll look like a “failure.” Swallow your pride. By not investigating as fully as you can, you are cutting off valuable sources of information that might help you enormously. Remember:<br class="calibre4"/>此外，不要因为你害怕如果你的计划没有实现，你就会看起来像一个“失败者”而犹豫不决地谈论你的计划咽下你的骄傲。如果你没有尽可能全面地调查，你就切断了可能对你有巨大帮助的有价值的信息来源。记住:</p>

<p class="noindent1">One of my students was concerned about being called a “talker” rather than a “doer” if she made too many false starts. There is no such thing as a false start if you are seriously committed to advancement. My first experience in the publishing world serves as a good example.<br class="calibre4"/>我的一个学生担心，如果她做了太多错误的开始，就会被称为“空谈家”而不是“实干家”。如果你认真地致力于进步，就不会有错误的开始。我在出版界的第一次经历就是一个很好的例子。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Years ago, I made the decision to publish a book of poems I had written. Since I knew nothing about the publishing world, I started talking to as many people as I could about how I should best proceed. I took a course on getting published; I called strangers who worked in various publishing houses (and was surprised that they were most willing to help); I submitted my book to about twenty publishers, and received one rejection after another. But I just kept talking about my career as a writer. I’m sure there were those who said, “Who’s she kidding? It will never happen.” Over lunch one day, Ellen Carr, a business associate and now a dear friend, and I decided to write and self-publish a short guidebook for women about getting a job. We were concerned about the number of talented women we knew whose fears of rejection and failure kept them from even trying to enter the job market. Again I started talking about our project to everyone I knew, and again a whole series of delays occurred that made some people doubt that the book would ever be published. But I just kept talking, as did Ellen, and we found ourselves meeting all sorts of interesting people who were invaluable in helping us with our project. And that joyous day did arrive when our books were finally delivered to us.<br class="calibre4"/>几年前，我决定出版一本我写的诗集。由于我对出版界一无所知，我开始和尽可能多的人谈论我应该如何最好地继续下去。我参加了一个关于出版的课程; 我给在不同出版社工作的陌生人打电话(他们最愿意帮忙，这让我感到惊讶) ; 我把我的书交给了大约20家出版商，但是一个接一个地被拒绝。但我只是不停地谈论我作为作家的职业生涯。我相信肯定有人会说”她在骗谁呢？这永远不会发生。”一天午餐时间，我和我的生意伙伴、现在的好朋友艾伦 · 卡尔决定为女性写一本关于找工作的简短指南，并自行出版。我们很担心我们认识的一些有才华的女性，她们害怕被拒绝和失败，甚至不敢尝试进入就业市场。我又一次开始向我认识的每个人谈论我们的项目，又一次发生了一系列的延误，使得一些人怀疑这本书是否会出版。但是我一直在说，就像 Ellen 一样，我们发现我们遇到了各种各样有趣的人，他们对我们的项目帮助很大。当我们的书最终被送到我们面前的时候，那个快乐的日子终于到来了。</p>
<p class="calibre9">It could be said that there were many false starts in my writing career. Not so! Each step along the way made me more and more ready to enter the field, even though the outcome may not have been in the form originally pictured. And I certainly learned how to deal with rejection! Putting your ideas out into the world by constantly talking about them may create a few doubting Thomases, yet not only does talking bring valuable information, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">it clarifies your intention to have it happen</em>! Intention is a powerful tool in creating something you want in your life.<br class="calibre4"/>可以说，在我的写作生涯中有许多错误的开始。不是这样的！一路上的每一步都让我越来越准备好进入这个领域，即使结果可能并不是最初想象的那样。我当然也学会了如何应对拒绝！通过不断地谈论你的想法，把它们放到世界上可能会产生一些怀疑的托马斯，然而谈话不仅带来有价值的信息，它澄清了你的意图，让它发生！意图是创造你生活中想要的东西的有力工具。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">3. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Establish your priorities.</em> This will require some soul-searching. Give yourself time really to think about what you want out of life. This is a very difficult thing to discover for most of us, since we are trained at an early age to do what other people want us to do. We are out of touch with those things that really bring us satisfaction. To make it easier, ask yourself which pathway is more in line with your overall goals in life— at the present time.<br class="calibre4"/>3.确定你的优先级。这需要一些自我反省。给自己时间好好想想你想从生活中得到什么。对我们大多数人来说，这是一件很难发现的事情，因为我们在很小的时候就被训练去做别人希望我们做的事情。我们与那些真正能给我们带来满足感的事情脱节了。为了让事情变得更简单，问问自己现在哪条路更符合你的人生目标。</p>
<p class="calibre9">It is important to remember that goals constantly change as you go through life, and you have to keep reassessing them. The decision you make today might not be the decision you would make five years from now. If you are having trouble clarifying your overall goals, don’t worry about it. It may take many more decisions and much more experimentation with different situations to discover how best to order your priorities. At least you are beginning to pay attention to who you are. Allow yourself confusion in the searching process. It is through confusion that you finally come to clarity.<br class="calibre4"/>重要的是要记住，目标随着你的生活不断变化，你必须不断地重新评估它们。你今天做的决定可能不是你五年后做的决定。如果你不能明确你的总体目标，不要担心。你可能需要做出更多的决定，在不同的情况下进行更多的实验，才能发现如何最好地安排你的优先事项。至少你开始关注自己是谁了。允许自己在搜索过程中感到困惑。通过困惑，你最终得到了清晰。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">4. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Trust your impulses.</em> Although you might have difficulty getting to the “person within” through the soul-searching process, your body sometimes gives some good clues about which way to go. Even after you’ve done your homework, talked to many people and come up with a logical choice, it is possible that your impulse is telling you to go with the other choice. Don’t be afraid to trust it. Very often your subconscious mind sends knowing messages as to which choice is better at a particular time. As you start paying attention to your impulses, you will be surprised at the good advice you are giving yourself.<br class="calibre4"/>4.相信你的冲动。尽管你可能很难通过自我反省的过程找到“内在的人”，但是你的身体有时会提供一些很好的线索，告诉你该走哪条路。即使你已经做完了功课，和很多人交谈过，并且做出了一个合乎逻辑的选择，你的冲动也有可能告诉你去做另一个选择。不要害怕去相信它。通常情况下，你的潜意识会在某个特定的时间发出明确的信息，告诉你哪个选择更好。当你开始注意你的冲动时，你会惊讶于你给自己的好建议。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I was surprised when I “trusted my gut” and found a new career. My intention after getting my doctorate in psychology was to ultimately set up a private practice. A few months after I began treating patients in a mental-health clinic the opportunity opened for me to help a friend who had become executive director of a marvelous health facility called “The Floating Hospital, New York’s Ship of Health.”<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre18"><a id="footnote_back1" shape="rect"></a><a href="#footnote1" shape="rect">1</a></sup> My instinct told me to take the job even though it didn’t logically fit into the plans I had made for myself.

<p class="calibre9">Within months, my friend resigned, and I was made executive director. Nowhere in my plan was it written that I would become an administrator. Previously, I had viewed myself as a follower, not a leader, and the whole concept of being at the helm had never entered my mind. Somehow my subconscious mind knew I could handle it and pushed me to take the job. “What am I doing here?” I asked myself as I went through fear and uncertainty in handling the tasks of the position. But as I  learned and grew with the job, I realized I loved administrative work and, in fact, became very capable in that area. In addition, the Floating Hospital brought me rich, wonderful, crazy, hilarious, poignant, and exciting experiences and challenges that I never thought would be possible for me. But my subconscious mind had known. It had overridden my conscious, logical mind, which had said, “Don’t deviate from your plan” and “You can’t handle this job.”<br class="calibre4"/>几个月后，我的朋友辞职了，我被任命为执行董事。在我的计划中，没有任何地方写着我会成为一名行政人员。在此之前，我把自己看作是一个追随者，而不是一个领导者，而掌舵这个概念从来没有进入过我的脑海。不知怎么的，我的潜意识知道我可以处理这件事，并且推动我接受这份工作。“我在这里做什么?”我问自己，在处理这个职位的任务时，我经历了恐惧和不确定性。但是随着我学习和工作的成长，我意识到我热爱行政工作，事实上，我在这方面变得非常能干。此外，浮动医院给我带来了丰富的，奇妙的，疯狂的，欢乐的，辛酸的，令人兴奋的经验和挑战，我从来没有想过我会是可能的。但是我的潜意识已经知道。它压倒了我有意识的逻辑思维，它告诉我，“不要偏离你的计划”和“你不能胜任这份工作”</p>
<p class="calibre9">I must make it clear, following the concept that there is no such thing as a wrong decision, that if I had chosen to remain a therapist in the mental-health clinic, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">that choice also would have brought me rich opportunities for experiencing life in a new and different way.</em> There was no right or wrong decision, just different ones.<br class="calibre4"/>我必须说清楚，根据这个概念，没有所谓的错误决定，如果我选择继续在精神健康诊所做治疗师，这个选择也会给我带来丰富的机会，以一种新的和不同的方式体验生活。没有正确或错误的决定，只有不同的决定。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">5. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Lighten up.</em> We live in a world where most people take themselves and their decisions very seriously. I have news for you. Nothing is <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">that</em> important. Honestly! If as a result of a decision you make, you lose some money, no problem—you learn to deal with losing money. If you lose a lover, no problem—you find another one. If you choose to divorce, no problem—you learn to handle living on your own. If you choose to marry, no problem—you learn to handle a new kind of sharing.<br class="calibre4"/>5.放轻松。我们生活在一个大多数人都非常认真对待自己和自己的决定的世界里。我有消息要告诉你。没什么是那么重要的。说真的！如果由于你的决定，你损失了一些钱，没有问题——你学会了处理损失的钱。如果你失去了一个爱人，没问题——你会找到另一个。如果你选择离婚，没问题——你学会了独立生活。如果你选择结婚，没有问题-你学会处理一种新的分享。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Start thinking about yourself as a lifetime student at a large university. Your curriculum is your total relationship with the world you live in, from the moment you’re born to the moment you die. Each experience is a valuable lesson to be learned. If you choose Path A, you will learn one set of lessons. If you choose Path B, you will learn a different set of lessons. Geology or geometry—just a different teacher and different books to read, different homework to do, different exams to take. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">It really doesn’t matter.</em> If you take Path A, you get to taste the strawberries. If you take Path B, you get to taste the blueberries. If you hate both strawberries and blueberries, you can find another path.

So<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">—lighten up</em>! Whatever happens as a result of your decision, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">you’ll handle it</em>!<br class="calibre4"/>开始把自己想象成一所大学的终身学生。你的课程是你与你所生活的世界的全部关系，从你出生的那一刻到你死去的那一刻。每一次经历都是值得学习的宝贵经验。如果你选择了路径 a，你将学到一系列的经验。如果你选择了路径 b，你将学到一套不同的课程。地质学或者几何学——只是不同的老师，不同的书要读，不同的作业要做，不同的考试要参加。这真的不重要。如果你走 a 路，你就能尝到草莓的味道。如果你选择路径 b，你就能尝到蓝莓的味道。如果你既讨厌草莓又讨厌蓝莓，你可以找到另一条路径。诀窍很简单，在你的教育论坛上，无论你处于什么位置，都要尽可能地了解你自己和你周围的世界。所以——放轻松！无论你的决定导致了什么结果，你都会处理好的！</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">After Making a Decision</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
在做出决定之后
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">1.<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5"> Throw away your picture.</em> We all create expectations of what we would like to happen after a decision is made. The picture in our mind’s eye might have served a valuable function in helping to make a decision. But once the decision is made, let the picture go. Since you can’t control the future, the picture can create unhappiness if it’s not fulfilled. Disappointment may make you miss the good that can come out of every situation in which you find yourself. Don’t forget to look for that silver lining. If you see the outcome of a decision as looking a certain way, you will increase the likelihood of missing other opportunities. Yet the unexpected opportunities can create more of value than your original picture. If you are focused on “the way it’s supposed to be,” you might miss the opportunity to enjoy the way it is or to have it be wonderful in a totally different way from what you imagined.<br class="calibre4"/>1.扔掉你的照片。在做出决定之后，我们都会对自己希望发生的事情产生期望。我们脑海中的画面可能在帮助做出决定方面起到了很有价值的作用。但是一旦做出了决定，就让这张图片消失吧。因为你无法控制未来，如果未来没有实现，那么这幅画面就会制造不幸。失望可能会让你错过每一个你发现自己处于的环境中所能带来的好处。不要忘记寻找一线希望。如果你认为一个决定的结果看起来是某种特定的方式，你将增加错过其他机会的可能性。然而，意想不到的机会会比你原来的想象创造更多的价值。如果你专注于“它应该是什么样子”，你可能会错过享受它是什么样子的机会，或者让它以一种完全不同于你想象的方式变得精彩。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">2.<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5"> Accept total responsibility for your decisions.</em> This is a tough one! We all have a tendency to look around for someone to blame if things are not working out to our liking. I really hated my stockbroker when the stock he recommended went down instead of up. It took great fortitude to admit to myself, “I made the decision to buy. No one twisted my arm.” I lamented until I created an “opportunity” from my ill-fated decision. What did I learn? A lot! I learned I had to find out more about the stock market, instead of relying totally on my stockbroker’s opinion. I learned that I was terribly insecure about money, and had to work on that. I learned I could lose money in the stock market and yet life went on just as it did before. I learned that if in the future I lost money in the stock market, it wouldn’t be such a big deal, and that stocks can go up again, as mine did eight months later. When looked at in that light, it wasn’t a bad decision after all. When you can find the <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">opportunity</em> in any decision, it is much easier to accept the <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">responsibility</em> for making it.<br class="calibre4"/>2.为自己的决定承担全部责任。这是一个艰难的决定！如果事情没有按照我们的意愿发展，我们都倾向于四处寻找可以指责的人。当我的股票经纪人推荐的股票下跌而不是上涨时，我真的很讨厌他。我需要很大的毅力才能向自己承认，“我做了买入的决定。没人强迫我。”我一直在哀叹，直到我从自己不幸的决定中创造了一个“机会”。我学到了什么？很多！我了解到我必须更多地了解股票市场，而不是完全依赖我的股票经纪人的意见。我发现自己对金钱非常没有安全感，所以我不得不在这方面努力。我知道我可以在股票市场上赔钱，但是生活还是和以前一样。我了解到，如果将来我在股票市场上赔了钱，那也不是什么大不了的事情，而且股票可以再次上涨，就像我的股票在8个月后所做的那样。从这个角度来看，这毕竟不是一个糟糕的决定。当你在任何决定中都能找到机会的时候，你就会更容易接受做出决定的责任。</p>
<p class="calibre9">When you take responsibility for your decisions, you become a lot less angry at the world, and, most important, a lot less angry at yourself!<br class="calibre4"/>当你为自己的决定负责的时候，你就不会那么生这个世界的气了，最重要的是，你也不会那么生自己的气了！</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">3. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Don’t protect, correct.</em> It is most important to commit yourself to any decision you make and give it all you’ve got. But if it doesn’t work out, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">change it</em>! Many of us are so invested in making the “right” decision that even if we find we don’t like the path we have chosen, we hang in there for dear life. To my way of thinking, this is the height of craziness. There is tremendous value in learning you <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">don’t</em> like something. Then it is simply a matter of changing your path. Yes, there are those who keep flitting from place to place, using “change it” as an excuse for noncommitment. I’m not talking about that, and you’ll know the difference within yourself. If you’ve truly committed yourself to something, given it everything you’ve got, and then concluded that it is not for you—move on to something else.<br class="calibre4"/>3.不要保护，正确。最重要的是，无论你做什么决定，都要全力以赴。但是如果没有成功，改变它！我们中的许多人如此投入于做出“正确”的决定，以至于即使我们发现自己不喜欢自己选择的道路，我们也会为了宝贵的生命而坚持下去。在我看来，这是疯狂的顶峰。学习你不喜欢的东西有着巨大的价值。那么，你只需要改变你的人生道路。是的，有些人不停地从一个地方转到另一个地方，用“改变它”作为不承诺的借口。我不是在说这个，你会知道自己内心的不同。如果你真的决心要做某件事，付出了你所拥有的一切，然后得出结论说它不适合你，那么就去做别的事情吧。</p>
<p class="calibre9">When you decide to change paths, you will often face criticism from those around you. “What do you mean you want to change your career? You’ve invested five years in building up your dental practice! All that time and money down the drain!” Explain that none of it has been a waste. At one time it was the right thing for you to do. Much was learned and much was gained in the way of experience. It simply doesn’t feel right anymore—it’s time to change. I know many people who stay locked in unsatisfactory situations that no longer work for them because they’ve invested so much and it would be a shame not to continue. How illogical! Why invest more, if it’s no longer paying off? Remember—the quality of your life is at stake!<br class="calibre4"/>当你决定改变道路时，你经常会面临来自周围人的批评。你说你想改变你的职业是什么意思？你已经花了五年的时间来建立你的牙科诊所！所有的时间和金钱都白费了!”解释一下，这一切都不是浪费。曾几何时，这对你来说是正确的选择。在经历的过程中，你学到了很多，也收获了很多。现在感觉不对劲了——是时候改变了。我认识很多人，他们因为投资太多而被困在不令人满意的环境中，不再为他们工作，如果不继续下去就太可惜了。多么不合逻辑！如果不再有回报，为什么还要加大投资？记住——你的生活质量岌岌可危！</p>
<p class="calibre9">In his book <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Actualizations,</em> Stewart Emery presents an excellent model for changing your direction in life. He learned it while seated on the flight deck of an airplane on the way to Honolulu. He noticed a console, which was identified by the pilot as the inertial guidance system. The purpose of the system was to get the plane within one thousand yards of the runway in Hawaii within five minutes of the estimated arrival time. Each time the plane strayed off course, the system corrected it. The pilot explained that they would arrive in Hawaii on time in spite of <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">“having been in error 90 percent of the time.”</em> Emery takes it from there, stating: “So the path from here to where we want to be starts with an error, which we correct, which becomes the next error, which we correct and that becomes the next error, which we correct. So the only time we are truly on course is that moment in the zigzag when we actually cross the true path.” From the analogy, we see that the trick in life is not to worry about making a wrong decision; <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">it’s learning when to correct</em>! My concept of the model looks like this:<br class="calibre4"/>斯图尔特 · 埃默里在他的《实现》一书中提出了一个改变你生活方向的绝佳模式。他在飞往檀香山的途中坐在飞机的驾驶舱里学到了这一点。他注意到了一个控制台，飞行员称之为惯性制导系统。这个系统的目的是让飞机在预计到达时间的5分钟内到达距离夏威夷跑道1000码的范围内。每次飞机偏离航线，系统都会修正它。飞行员解释说，他们将准时到达夏威夷，尽管“90% 的时间出现了错误”Emery 接着说: “从这里到我们想要到达的地方的路径从一个错误开始，我们纠正它，它变成下一个错误，我们纠正它，它变成下一个错误，我们纠正它。因此，我们唯一真正走上正轨的时候，就是我们真正跨过正确路径的那一刻。”从这个类比中，我们可以看到生活中的诀窍不是担心做出错误的决定，而是学会何时改正！我的模型概念是这样的:</p>
<div class="centeredimage"><div class="calibre4"><img alt="15offcourse.jpg" id="img16" src="image/15offcourse.jpg" class="calibre21"/></div></div>
<p class="noindent">There are many inner clues that help you know when it is time to correct. The two most obvious are confusion and dissatisfaction. Ironically, these are considered negatives, instead of positives. I know it is hard to accept, but <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">an upset in your life is beneficial</em>, in that it tells you that you are off course in some way and you need to find your way back to your particular path of clarity once again. Your confusion and dissatisfaction are telling you that you’re offtrack, and, as a friend once suggested to me, “If you don’t change your direction, you’re likely to end up where you’re heading.”<br class="calibre4"/>有许多内在的线索可以帮助你知道什么时候该改正。最明显的两点是困惑和不满。具有讽刺意味的是，这些被认为是消极的，而不是积极的。我知道这很难接受，但是生活中的烦恼是有益的，因为它告诉你，你在某种程度上偏离了轨道，你需要再次找到回到你特定的清晰之路的路径。你的困惑和不满正在告诉你你偏离了轨道，正如一位朋友曾经对我建议的那样，“如果你不改变你的方向，你很可能最终会走到你要走的路上。”</p>
<p class="calibre9">Physical pain is easily seen as beneficial, even though it can be very uncomfortable. It is an obvious symptom that something is wrong with your body. A pain in your right side might save your life by signaling an appendicitis attack. If you don’t pay attention to it, you could die. Mental pain is just as much a “blessing,” because it is telling you that something is wrong with the way your life is going. It is a sign that something needs correction—whether it is the way you think about the world or what you are doing in the world—or both. The pain is simply saying, “Hey, that’s not it!”<br class="calibre4"/>身体上的疼痛很容易被认为是有益的，尽管它可能会让人非常不舒服。这是一个明显的症状，你的身体出了问题。右侧疼痛可能通过发出阑尾炎发作的信号而挽救你的生命。如果你不注意它，你可能会死。精神上的痛苦同样是一种“祝福”，因为它告诉你，你的生活方式出了问题。这是一种迹象，表明有些事情需要改正——无论是你思考世界的方式，还是你在这个世界上所做的事情——或两者兼而有之。痛苦只是在说: “嘿，不是这样的!”</p>
<p class="calibre9">The way to figure out how to get back on course is through the exploration process—reaching out through self-help books, workshops, friends, support groups, therapy, or whatever seems right for you when you reach out for help. As long as you are open to reaching out, help will be there. Remember, “When the student is ready, the teacher will appear.” You will never be ready if you are busy protecting the course you have chosen for yourself. You will be perpetually off course and never reach your destination. When you are constantly aware of the clues that signal “time to correct,” you will always end up in the right spot—or at least in the vicinity.<br class="calibre4"/>找出如何回到正轨的方法是通过探索的过程——通过自助书籍，工作坊，朋友，支持小组，治疗，或者任何当你寻求帮助时适合你的方法。只要你愿意伸出援手，帮助就会一直存在。记住，“当学生准备好了，老师就会出现。”如果你忙于保护你为自己选择的课程，你永远不会准备好。你将永远偏离航线，永远无法到达目的地。当你不断地意识到“修正时间”的信号时，你总是会到达正确的位置——或者至少是在附近。</p>

<p class="spaceabove1">Does this last summary sound painfully (and comically) familiar? Yes, we certainly do know how to drive ourselves crazy!<br class="calibre4"/>最后这个总结听起来是不是很耳熟? 是的，我们当然知道如何让自己发疯！</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">Now that I’ve demonstrated the No-Win and No-Lose Models as they pertain to decision making, I trust you can see how it is impossible to make a mistake. Just as each decision is an opportunity to learn, each “mistake” is also an opportunity to learn, rendering it impossible to make a mistake. A great researcher, having “failed” two hundred times before he found the answer to one of his burning questions, was asked, “Doesn’t it bother you that you failed all those times?” His answer was, “I never failed! I discovered two hundred ways <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">not</em> to do something!”<br class="calibre4"/>现在，我已经演示了不输不赢的模型，因为它们与决策相关，我相信你可以看到，犯错误是不可能的。正如每一个决定都是一个学习的机会，每一个“错误”也是一个学习的机会，使得不可能犯错误。一位伟大的研究人员，在“失败”了200次之后，才找到了一个问题的答案，他被问到，“你失败了那么多次，难道你不觉得困扰吗?”他的回答是: “我从未失败过！我发现了两百种不做某事的方法!”</p>
<p class="calibre9">After much consideration, I have come to the conclusion that if you haven’t made any mistakes lately, you must be doing something wrong. You’ll never get to Hawaii! You haven’t even left the airport yet! You’ve never even gotten off the ground! You are taking no risks—nor are you enjoying the “goodies” life has to offer. What a waste!<br class="calibre4"/>经过深思熟虑，我得出结论，如果你最近没有犯任何错误，那么你一定是做错了什么。你永远到不了夏威夷！你还没离开机场呢！你从来没有离开过地面！你没有冒任何风险——也没有享受生活所提供的“好东西”。真是浪费！</p>
<p class="calibre9">I remember a time in my life when I was frightened of just about everything—fearful that I would fail in all my attempts to fulfill my dreams. So I just stayed home, a victim of all my insecurities. I’d like to report that it was an ancient Zen master who snapped me back into awareness. But it wasn’t. It was actually an airline commercial that used the slogan “Get into this world.” When I saw the commercial, I suddenly realized that I had stopped participating in the world. With this “enlightenment,” I started pushing myself out there once again. I realized that I had to shift from being afraid of making a mistake to being afraid of <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">not</em> making a mistake. If I am not making any mistakes, I can be sure I am not learning and growing.<br class="calibre4"/>我记得在我的生命中有一段时间，我对几乎所有的事情都感到恐惧——害怕我会在所有实现梦想的尝试中失败。所以我只能呆在家里，成为我所有不安全感的受害者。我想报告一下，是一位古老的禅宗大师让我恢复了知觉。但事实并非如此。它实际上是一个航空公司的广告，使用的口号是“进入这个世界”当我看到广告的时候，我突然意识到我已经不再参与这个世界了。带着这种“顿悟”，我开始再次把自己推向那里。我意识到我必须从害怕犯错转变为害怕不犯错。如果我没有犯任何错误，我可以肯定我没有学习和成长。</p>
<p class="calibre9">When you consider that mistakes are an integral part of living, it is amazing how we are taught to think that we must be perfect. This “mistake” in our thinking has created many fears about being adventurous and trying out new territories. Let’s take an example from a favorite national pastime, baseball. It is extremely rare for a baseball player to attain a .400 average. Translated, that means having a hit four times out of ten at bat—four successes out of ten tries. That’s a champion’s performance—and most of us are just beginners!<br class="calibre4"/>当你认为错误是生活中不可或缺的一部分时，你会惊讶地发现，我们是如何被教导认为我们必须是完美的。我们思维中的这个“错误”已经造成了许多对冒险和尝试新领域的恐惧。让我们以国民运动中最受欢迎的一项运动——棒球为例。棒球运动员的平均成绩达到0.400是极其罕见的。换句话说，这意味着击球命中率为10次击球中的4次——10次尝试中的4次成功。这就是冠军的表现——而我们大多数人只是初学者！</p>
<p class="calibre9">You are not going to succeed in everything you attempt in life. That’s guaranteed. In fact, the more you do in life, the more chance there is to <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">not</em> succeed in some things. Look at how rich your life can be, however, from your many adventures. Win or lose, you just keep winning! Using the Off Course / Correct Model, you can now have a new freedom in flying.<br class="calibre4"/>你不可能在生活中尝试的每件事情上都成功。这是肯定的。事实上，你在生活中做的越多，你就越有可能在某些事情上失败。看看你的生活是多么丰富，然而，从你的许多冒险。无论输赢，你都会一直赢下去！使用偏离航向/正确模型，你现在可以有一个新的自由飞行。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Although you now know how to minimize your fears about decision making and making a mistake, you might notice that adopting the concepts presented is more difficult than it sounds. Again I remind you of the lengthy process involved in behavior change. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Simply begin!</em> Keep working on it. Keep reinforcing the new way of thinking presented here by using the exercises below to help you push through your fears about making decisions or mistakes.<br class="calibre4"/>尽管您现在知道如何最大限度地减少您对做决定和犯错误的恐惧，但您可能会注意到，采用所提出的概念比听起来要难得多。我再次提醒你，行为改变是一个漫长的过程。开始吧！继续努力。通过下面的练习来帮助你克服对做决定或犯错误的恐惧，从而不断强化这里提出的新的思维方式。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Have you made any mistakes lately? I hope so!<br class="calibre4"/>你最近犯过什么错误吗? 我希望如此！</p>

<br class="calibre4"/>
练习
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">1. Using the No-Lose Model, consider some decisions you are now facing. Write down all the positive things that can happen by using either pathway—even if the outcome might not be what you picture.<br class="calibre4"/>1.使用无损模型，考虑一下你现在面临的一些决定。写下使用任何一种途径都可能发生的所有积极的事情——即使结果可能不是你想象的那样。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">2. Learn the concept IT DOESN’T REALLY MATTER by starting with little decisions you face each day. As you ponder which suit to wear to the office, notice that it doesn’t really matter; which restaurant to eat at tonight, it doesn’t really matter; which movie to see, it doesn’t really matter. Each choice simply produces a different experience. Slowly you will be able to apply this concept to larger and larger decisions. Put signs in your home and office that say<br class="calibre4"/>2.从你每天面对的小决定开始学习这个概念其实并不重要。当你考虑穿哪套衣服去办公室时，注意到这并不重要; 今晚在哪家餐馆吃饭，这并不重要; 看哪部电影，这并不重要。每一个选择都会带来不同的体验。慢慢地，你将能够把这个概念应用到越来越大的决策中。在你的家里和办公室放一些标语，上面写着</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="smallcaps">IT DOESN’T REALLY MATTER</span>
<br class="calibre4"/>
这并不重要
</p>
<p class="noindent1">to remind yourself when you are being needlessly obsessive.<br class="calibre4"/>当你不必要地强迫自己的时候，提醒自己。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">3. Also, put signs in your home and office that say<br class="calibre4"/>同时，在你的家里和办公室里放一些标语，上面写着</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="smallcaps">SO WHAT! I’LL HANDLE IT!</span>
<br class="calibre4"/>
那又怎样! 我来处理！
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">If things don’t work out the way you want, so what! What’s the big deal, anyway? This reminder will help you lighten up about life as you learn you can handle whatever happens after you’ve made your decision.<br class="calibre4"/>如果事情不如你所愿，那又怎样！有什么大不了的？这个提醒会帮助你放松对生活的态度，因为你知道在你做出决定之后，你可以处理任何事情。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">4. Look at clues in your life that suggest you are off course and begin making your game plan to correct the situation.<br class="calibre4"/>4.看看你生活中那些暗示你偏离轨道的线索，开始制定你的游戏计划来纠正这种情况。</p>

<p class="noindent1">At the time, The Floating Hospital was located aboard a ship and sailed around Manhattan while delivering health-care services to the poor. After September 11, 2001, the ship was sold, as it was unable to secure affordable and accessible dock space. It is now land-based and continues to provide services to the poor.<br class="calibre4"/>当时，漂浮医院坐落在一艘船上，在曼哈顿附近航行，为穷人提供医疗服务。2001年9月11日之后，这艘船被卖掉了，因为它无法获得负担得起和可以进入的码头空间。现在它以陆地为基础，继续为穷人提供服务。</p>
