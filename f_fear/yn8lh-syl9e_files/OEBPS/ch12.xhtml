<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="drop">T</span>here you sit . . . filled with all sorts of information about how to make yourself powerful in the face of all your fears. What’s next? What can I say to you to help keep you on course as you continue on the next part of your journey? First, the encouragement and motivation you have already received from this book will always be here for you whenever you need them. When you feel you are going off course or are being battered by outside forces, come back and reread the parts that make you feel good. Also, since <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Feel the Fear . . . and Do It Anyway!</em> was originally published, I have written <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Feel the Fear . . . and Beyond</em> to give you practice using the exercises you have learned from this book. The more practice the better!<br class="calibre4"/>你坐在那里，充满了各种各样的信息关于如何让自己在面对所有的恐惧时变得强大。接下来呢？当你继续下一段旅程的时候，我能对你说些什么来帮助你走上正轨呢？首先，你已经从这本书中得到的鼓励和动力，无论何时你需要它们，它们都会一直在你身边。当你觉得自己偏离了轨道或者被外界的力量打击的时候，回来重读那些让你感觉良好的部分。还有，既然感受到了恐惧... ... 那就无论如何去做吧！最初出版的时候，我写了《感受恐惧》和《超越恐惧》 ，让你练习你从这本书中学到的练习。练习得越多越好！</p>
<p class="calibre9">The biggest pitfall as you make your way through life is impatience. Remember that being impatient is simply a way of punishing yourself. It creates stress, dissatisfaction, and fear. Whenever your Chatterbox is making you feel impatient, ask it, “What’s the rush? It’s all happening perfectly. Don’t worry. When I am ready to move forward I will. In the meantime, I am taking it all in and I am learning.”<br class="calibre4"/>生活中最大的陷阱就是缺乏耐心。记住，不耐烦只是一种惩罚自己的方式。它会产生压力、不满和恐惧。每当你的话匣子让你感到不耐烦的时候，问它: “急什么？一切都很完美。别担心。当我准备好向前看的时候，我会的。与此同时，我正在接受这一切，我正在学习。”</p>
<p class="calibre9">When we wake up to the potential power within, our impulse is to grab it all “quick.” The more we grab, the more it seems to elude us. There is no quick. There are quick—and wonderful—seminars, workshops, books, and audios that give you tools, but they are not quick tools. They are to be used and mastered throughout a lifetime.<br class="calibre4"/>当我们意识到内在潜在的力量时，我们的冲动就是“快速地”抓住它我们抓住的越多，它似乎就越逃避我们。没有快速。研讨会、讲习班、书籍和音频可以给你提供快速而精彩的工具，但它们不是快速的工具。它们需要一生的使用和掌握。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I liken our impatience to an incident with my son when he was a little boy. I showed him how to plant a seed in a flowerpot and explained that soon, from the little seed, a beautiful flower would appear. I left him with his flowerpot and went on to do other things. Much later I returned to his room and saw he had placed a chair in front of the flowerpot and was sitting there watching it. I asked him what he was doing, and he said, “I’m waiting for the flower to appear.” I realized I had neglected something in my explanation. So don’t let me do the same thing to you.<br class="calibre4"/>我把我们的不耐烦比作我儿子小时候的一件事。我教他如何在花盆里种下一颗种子，并解释说，很快，一朵美丽的花就会从这颗小种子里开出来。我把花盆留给他，然后继续做其他的事情。很久以后，我回到他的房间，看到他在花盆前放了一把椅子，坐在那里看着花盆。我问他在干什么，他说: “我在等着花儿出现。”我意识到我在解释中忽略了一些东西。所以不要让我对你做同样的事。</p>
<p class="calibre9">So often when we are discouraged, thinking that we are learning nothing from all our efforts, changes are really taking place within us. We become aware of them long after they have been going on. Ultimately, my son did have his flower. One day he awoke and it was there. Although it didn’t look like anything was happening, it was. And so it is with you.<br class="calibre4"/>所以，当我们感到沮丧，认为我们从所有的努力中什么也没有学到的时候，改变就在我们的内心发生。我们在它们发生很久之后才意识到它们的存在。最终，我的儿子得到了他的花。有一天他醒来，花就在那儿。虽然看起来没什么事发生，但确实发生了。你也一样。</p>
<p class="calibre9">One day, I threw a log on the smoldering embers of a dying fire and returned to the book I was reading. From time to time, I’d glance over at the fire and notice that there was no flame yet. There wasn’t even the smoke that often signals a fire to come. Then, as I stared at the seemingly dead fire, flames suddenly burst out around the log. Patience means knowing it will happen . . . and giving it time to happen.<br class="calibre4"/>有一天，我把一根木头扔在一堆即将熄灭的火的余烬上，然后回到我正在读的那本书上。我时不时地瞥一眼火焰，注意到还没有火焰。甚至连通常预示着火灾即将来临的烟都没有。然后，当我盯着看起来已经熄灭的火焰时，火焰突然在圆木周围燃烧起来。耐心意味着知道它会发生... ... 并且给它时间去发生。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Again, it requires TRUST—trust that it is all happening perfectly. What do I mean by “perfectly”? I have come to believe there are only two kinds of experiences in life: those that stem from our Higher Self and those that have something to teach us. We recognize the first as pure joy and the latter as struggle. But they are both perfect. Each time we confront some intense difficulty, we know there is something we haven’t learned yet, and the universe is now giving us the opportunity to learn. If we go through the experience with this in mind, all the “victim” is taken out of the situation, and we allow ourselves to say YES. Thus, no matter what is happening at any particular time in your life, keep in mind that it is all perfect.<br class="calibre4"/>同样，它需要信任——相信一切都在完美地发生。我所说的“完美”是什么意思？我已经开始相信生活中只有两种经历: 一种来自于我们的更高自我，另一种来自于我们需要学习的东西。我们认识到前者是纯粹的快乐，后者是挣扎。但它们都是完美的。每次我们面对一些强烈的困难，我们知道有一些东西我们还没有学会，宇宙现在正在给我们机会去学习。如果我们带着这种想法经历这段经历，那么所有的“受害者”都会被排除在外，我们允许自己说“是”。因此，无论在你生命中的任何特定时刻发生了什么，请记住，一切都是完美的。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As long as you can remember that life is an ongoing process of learning, you won’t have the disgruntling sense that you haven’t made it yet. My experience of the last few years has shown me that so much of the joy in life is the challenge of figuring it all out. Nothing is as satisfying as those moments of breakthrough when you discover something about yourself and the universe that adds another piece to the jigsaw puzzle. The joy of discovery is delicious. I know of no explorer who once having reached his or her goal has not wanted to go out and explore some more.<br class="calibre4"/>只要你能记住生活是一个不断学习的过程，你就不会有那种还没有成功的不快感觉。我过去几年的经历告诉我，生活中有太多的快乐都是在挑战自我。没有什么比那些突破性的时刻更令人满足的了，当你发现关于你自己和宇宙的一些东西，这些东西又为拼图增加了一块。发现的快乐是美味的。我知道没有一个探险家一旦达到了他或她的目标就不想出去探索更多的东西。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The challenge is to stay on the Path of the Higher Self. It is a far more enjoyable journey than the other paths you may choose to follow. You will know if you are on the right path by the way you feel. Trust your feelings. If the path you’re on isn’t providing you joy, satisfaction, creativity, love, and caring, that’s not it. Say to yourself, “Okay, I tried this, and this isn’t it. What else can I try?” Don’t be deceived into thinking that by changing the external, the internal will be changed. It works the other way around.<br class="calibre4"/>挑战是保持在更高自我的道路上。这是一个比你可能选择的其他道路更令人愉快的旅程。通过你的感觉，你会知道你是否走在正确的道路上。相信你的感觉。如果你所走的道路没有给你带来快乐、满足、创造力、爱和关怀，那就不是这样。对自己说: “好吧，我试过了，但是不是这样的。我还能试什么?”不要误以为改变外在就能改变内在。事实恰恰相反。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The path that needs changing is the one in your mind. This is not to say that once you become aligned with your Higher Self, you won’t want to change things in your physical world, but it is your mind that has to be changed first—then all that is right will follow.<br class="calibre4"/>需要改变的道路就是你脑海中的那条。这并不是说一旦你与你的更高自我结盟，你就不会想要改变你物质世界中的事情，但是你的头脑必须首先被改变——然后所有正确的事情都会随之而来。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The Path is much like the experience of climbing a mountain. The climb is tough. But each time you stop to look around, the view becomes more spectacular. You see a greater expanse, and the “flaws” of the world below disappear as you see more and more of the whole. As you climb higher, you are detached from the heaviness below. You feel lighter. You feel freer. And you are propelled higher by the increasing beauty you see.<br class="calibre4"/>这条路很像爬山的经历。攀登是艰难的。但是每次你停下来环顾四周，景色都会变得更加壮观。你看到了更广阔的世界，当你看到越来越多的整个世界时，下面世界的“缺陷”消失了。当你爬得更高的时候，你就脱离了下面的沉重。你会觉得更轻松。你感觉更自由。你看到的越来越多的美丽推动着你走得越来越高。</p>
<p class="calibre9">From this vantage point, you become more compassionate as well. You may dislike some individuals intensely for their cruel behavior. But from a higher place, you’ll see more of the whole. These individuals are more than their “flawed” behavior. They, too, have a magnificent interior place, which they haven’t discovered yet. Hence you’ll begin to feel their sadness and not be so harsh in your judgment.<br class="calibre4"/>从这个角度来看，你也变得更有同情心了。你可能会因为某些人的残忍行为而强烈地讨厌他们。但是从更高的地方，你会看到更多的整体。这些个体不仅仅是他们“有缺陷的”行为。他们也有一个宏伟的内部空间，他们还没有发现。因此，你会开始感受到他们的悲伤，并且在你的判断中不那么苛刻。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The journey upward is not always a steady climb. You may climb, then stop and rest, regroup. So, too, with the spiritual journey. Sometimes it may seem as though you have stopped growing. Not so. You are just consolidating your information.<br class="calibre4"/>向上的旅程并不总是一个稳定的攀登。你可以攀登，然后停下来休息，重新集结。精神之旅也是如此。有时候你看起来好像停止了成长。并非如此。你只是在巩固你的信息。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Some of what you learn may require that you drop beliefs and behavior that have been part of you from the time you were born. Sometimes you’ll experience an <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">aha!</em> and transformation will seem instant. Again, not so. Sudden insights are the result of all that has happened before. Your Subconscious Mind, as the computer, searches and sorts without your awareness and, when you least expect it, comes up with the answer. Insights happen more frequently, however, the farther along the journey you are. The Conscious Mind lets go of its resistance to new ways of thinking. It develops more trust. The initial stages are the most difficult and require the greatest concentration.<br class="calibre4"/>你所学到的一些东西可能需要你放弃从你出生起就已经成为你一部分的信仰和行为。有时候你会经历一次“啊哈”！转变似乎是瞬间发生的。然而，事实并非如此。突然的洞察力是之前发生的一切的结果。你的潜意识，就像电脑一样，在你意识不到的情况下进行搜索和分类，在你最意想不到的时候，找到答案。然而，随着你的旅程越来越远，洞察力发生的越来越频繁。有意识的思维放弃了对新思维方式的抵制。它会产生更多的信任。最初的阶段是最困难的，需要最大程度的专注。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Sometimes when you think you’ve finally “got it,” the universe will step in to show you haven’t. I’ve adopted a phrase of Lena Horne’s that keeps me humble: “I’ve come a long way . . . maybe!” I have learned that there is always more to learn. And experience is our greatest teacher.<br class="calibre4"/>有时候，当你认为自己终于“得到了它”，宇宙会介入，告诉你还没有。我采用了莉娜 · 霍恩(Lena Horne)的一句话，这句话让我保持谦逊: “我已经走了很长的路... ... 也许吧!”我已经明白，总有更多的东西需要学习。经验是我们最伟大的老师。</p>
<p class="calibre9">That is why I am so in love with the aging process. Youth so rarely understands what age allows us to know. We need to go through many life experiences before the power within is brought forward in all its glory. And as long as we see ourselves as unfolding beings, there is no wish to go back one single day—and age becomes a beautiful thing.<br class="calibre4"/>这就是为什么我如此热爱衰老的过程。年轻人很少理解年龄让我们知道什么。我们需要经历许多人生经历，才能让内在的力量在所有的荣耀中得到提升。只要我们把自己看作是正在展开的存在，我们就不会希望回到某一天——年龄就会变成一件美好的事情。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">One of my favorite passages reflecting the agony and ecstasy of our journey is from <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">The Velveteen Rabbit</em> by Margery Williams. In the story, two nursery toys, the Skin Horse and the Rabbit, talk about becoming Real:<br class="calibre4"/>我最喜欢的一段反映了我们旅途中的痛苦和狂喜，这段话来自玛吉 · 威廉姆斯的《天鹅绒兔子》。在这个故事里，两个托儿所玩具，皮马和兔子，谈论着成为真实的:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre6">
<p class="noindent">“Does it hurt?” asked the Rabbit.<br class="calibre4"/>兔子问: “疼吗?”。</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Sometimes,” said the Skin Horse, for he was always truthful. “When you are Real, you don’t mind being hurt.”<br class="calibre4"/>“有时候,”皮马说，因为他总是诚实的。“当你是真实的，你不介意被伤害。”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Does it happen all at once, like being wound up,” he asked, “or bit by bit?”<br class="calibre4"/>“是突然发生的，就像上了发条一样,”他问，“还是一点一点地?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“It doesn’t happen all at once,” said the Skin Horse. “You become. It takes a long time. That’s why it doesn’t often happen to people who break easily, or have sharp edges, or who have to be carefully kept. Generally, by the time you are Real, most of your hair has been loved off, and your eyes drop out and you get loose in the joints and very shabby. But these things don’t matter at all, because once you are Real you can’t be ugly, except to people who don’t understand.”<br class="calibre4"/>“它不会一下子全部发生,”皮马说。你变成了。这需要很长的时间。这就是为什么它不经常发生在那些容易折断的人身上，或者有锋利的边缘，或者需要小心保存的人身上。一般来说，当你真实存在的时候，你的大部分头发都已经脱落了，你的眼珠子掉了下来，关节松动，衣衫褴褛。但是这些都不重要，因为一旦你是真实的，你就不会丑，除非是对那些不理解你的人。”</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">There is so much excitement and wonder in front of you. Sometimes you will experience the ecstasy of being in the flow. Sometimes you will experience the agony of being way off course. Remember you are not alone. This is a world filled with an abundance of support systems that are there for the taking whenever you are feeling troubled by life’s experiences. One of my students said to me, “I read and read, and I assume one day one of those books is going to take!” I shot back, “No. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Nothing is going to take unless you take it!</em>” And so it is with this book and every source available to you. <strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">DON’T WAIT FOR IT TO TAKE! TAKE IT!</strong> Use it. Live it. Absorb it. Unless you use the muscle that lifts you to your Higher Self, it will weaken—just as your body weakens when it is not used. If you think you need additional help, then by all means enlist the aid of a professional. Take action. Nothing is going to work for you unless you do the work.<br class="calibre4"/>在你面前有如此多的兴奋和惊奇。有时你会体验到随波逐流的狂喜。有时你会体验到偏离轨道的痛苦。记住，你并不孤单。这是一个充满了大量支持系统的世界，无论何时，当你感到生活的经历困扰时，这些支持系统就在那里等着你去获取。我的一个学生对我说: “我读了又读，我想总有一天这些书会被我拿走!”我反驳道: “不。除非你接受，否则什么都不会发生!”这本书以及你可以获得的所有资源都是如此。不要等待它的到来！拿着！好好利用。活在当下。吸收它。除非你使用提升你到更高自我的肌肉，否则它会变弱——就像你的身体在不使用它时变弱一样。如果你认为自己需要额外的帮助，那么请务必寻求专业人士的帮助。采取行动。除非你做了工作，否则什么都不会为你工作。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Say YES to life. Participate. Move. Act. Write. Read. Sign up. Take a stand. Or do whatever it takes for you. Get involved in the process. As Rollo May wrote in <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Man’s Search for Himself</em>: “Every organism has one and only one central need in life, to fulfill its own potentialities.” He goes on to say that joy is the result of using our powers to their fullest, and for that reason, joy, not happiness, is the goal of life.<br class="calibre4"/>对生活说 YES。参与。动起来。行动。写作。阅读。注册。表明立场。或者为你做任何事。参与这个过程。正如罗洛 · 梅在《人类寻找自我》一书中写道: “每个有机体在生命中都有一个并且只有一个中心需求，以满足其自身的潜能。”他接着说，快乐是充分利用我们的能力的结果，因此，快乐，而不是幸福，是生活的目标。</p>
<p class="calibre9">And what is joy? It is something that expresses the ebullience of the spiritual part of ourselves. Joy is characterized by lightness, humor, laughter, and gaiety. Lighten up. If you have ever been around a person who is centered and enlightened, you are struck with their humor and ability to laugh at themselves. All the brittleness is gone, and only fluidity remains.<br class="calibre4"/>那么什么是快乐呢？它是一种表达我们精神部分的热情的东西。快乐拥有属性: 轻松、幽默、欢笑和快乐。放松。如果你曾经和一个集中精神、开明的人在一起，你会被他们的幽默感和自嘲的能力所打动。所有的脆弱都消失了，只剩下流动性。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I took time as I was in the middle of writing this chapter to join in the Hands Across America event.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre18"><a id="footnote_back1" shape="rect"></a><a href="#footnote1" shape="rect">1</a></sup> As we all stood singing “Hands Across America,” the theme song, I looked at the faces around me. For those few moments in time, everyone participating <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">knew</em> they made a difference. It was reflected on their faces. They were joyous. They were loving. They were caring. They were touching the highest part of themselves. Many were crying tears of joy. It feels so good to align yourself with some higher purpose. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">To become involved is to reduce our fear.</em> We become bigger, we move away from that “feverish, selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making us happy.” We move into true adult status, where we have much to give to this world.<br class="calibre4"/>当我们站在一起唱主题曲“ Hands Across America”时，我看着周围的人们。在那短暂的时间里，每个参与者都知道他们有所作为。这反映在他们的脸上。他们很高兴。他们充满爱。他们关心我。他们触摸着自己最高的部分。许多人喜极而泣。让自己与更高的目标保持一致的感觉真好。参与其中就是减少我们的恐惧。我们变得更大，我们远离那种“狂热的、自私的、抱怨世界不会致力于让我们幸福的疾病和不满的小团体。”我们变成了真正的成年人，我们可以给这个世界很多东西。</p>
<p class="calibre9">So commit! Commit yourself to pushing through the fear and becoming more than you are at the present moment. The you that could be is absolutely colossal. You don’t need to change what you are doing—simply commit to learning how to bring to whatever you do in life the loving and powerful energy of your Higher Self. Whether you are a bank teller, housewife, corporate executive, student, street cleaner, teacher, film producer, salesperson, lawyer, or whatever, it’s yours to give. As you live this way, moment by moment, day by day, in perfect time, you will find yourself moving closer and closer to Home. The paradox is that when you stay close to Home, you can go anywhere and do anything without fear. The Divine Homesickness disappears as you find the place where we all are connected as loving human beings. Whatever it takes to get you there, <strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">FEEL THE FEAR . . . AND DO IT ANYWAY!</strong><br class="calibre4"/>所以，承诺！承诺自己克服恐惧，成为比现在更好的自己。那个可以成为的自己绝对是巨大的。你不需要改变你正在做的事情——只需要致力于学习如何把你更高自我的爱和强大能量带到你生活中的任何事情上。无论你是银行出纳员、家庭主妇、公司高管、学生、街道清洁工、教师、电影制片人、销售人员、律师，还是其他什么人，你都可以给予。当你以这种方式生活，时时刻刻，日复一日，在完美的时间，你会发现自己离家越来越近。矛盾的是，当你离家很近的时候，你可以去任何地方，做任何事情都不用担心。神圣的思乡之情消失了，因为你找到了一个地方，在那里，我们所有人都作为充满爱的人类联系在一起。无论付出什么代价，都要感受恐惧，无论如何都要去做！</p>

<p class="noindent1">On May 25, 1986, more than five million people paid ten dollars to join hands, all at the same time, and form a line that stretched 4,152 miles from New York to California, all to raise money for the hungry and homeless and to call attention to America’s poor. It was called Hands Across America.<br class="calibre4"/>1986年5月25日，超过500万人同时支付了10美元，组成了一条从纽约到加利福尼亚长达4152英里的队伍，为饥饿和无家可归的人们筹集资金，并呼吁人们关注美国的穷人。它被称为“全美之手”。</p>
