<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="drop">A</span>re you a “victim,” or are you taking responsibility for your life? So many of us <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">think</em> we are taking responsibility for our own lives when we simply are not. The “victim” mentality is very subtle and takes many forms. Once you understand the concepts in this chapter you will better understand the dynamics of handling fear.<br class="calibre4"/>你是一个“受害者”，还是对自己的生活负责？我们中的很多人都认为自己应该为自己的生活负责，但事实并非如此。“受害者”的心态是非常微妙的，并且有很多种形式。一旦你理解了本章中的概念，你就会更好地理解处理恐惧的动力学。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The idea of taking responsibility for your own life is probably not totally new to you. For years you have been bombarded with the message: TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR OWN LIFE.<br class="calibre4"/>为自己的生活负责的想法对你来说可能并不是全新的。多年来，你一直被这样的信息轰炸: 为自己的生活负责。</p>
<p class="calibre9"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">But I am convinced that most of us do not really understand what that means.</em>
<br class="calibre4"/>
但我确信，我们大多数人并不真正理解这句话的含义。
</p>
<p class="calibre9">To most of us “independent” people, it has meant that we should get a job, earn enough money to support ourselves, and not depend on anyone else for our survival. That may or may not be part of it (I know many “dependent” people who understand the secret of taking responsibility for their experience of life), but it certainly doesn’t hit the heart of the issue, which is much bigger, yet more invisible, than that. Let’s look at a few examples.<br class="calibre4"/>对于我们大多数“独立”的人来说，这意味着我们应该找到一份工作，赚足够的钱来养活自己，而不是依靠别人来生存。这可能是也可能不是其中的一部分(我认识很多“依赖型”人士，他们知道为自己的生活经历负责的秘密) ，但它肯定不会触及问题的核心，这个问题比那个问题大得多，但更加隐蔽。让我们来看几个例子。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Edward is an extremely wealthy, high-powered executive who lives in a constant state of anxiety. When I suggested that he get some professional help, he responded that if the people in his life would change, everything would be fine. If only his wife would be more loving, if only his boss wasn’t always leaning on him, and if only his son would stop taking drugs—then he’d be fine. He feels that there is no reason for him to get help; it’s all <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">their</em> fault. Is he taking responsibility for his experience of life? Absolutely not!<br class="calibre4"/>爱德华是一个非常富有，有权有势的执行官，他一直生活在焦虑之中。当我建议他寻求专业帮助时，他回答说，如果他生活中的人会改变，一切都会好起来的。如果他的妻子能更有爱心，如果他的老板不总是依赖他，如果他的儿子能停止吸毒，那么他就会好起来。他觉得他没有理由去寻求帮助，这都是他们的错。他对自己的人生经历负责吗？当然不是！</p>
<p class="calibre9">Mara is, objectively, sitting on top of the world. She has a great job, lives in a lovely apartment, and has many friends and lovers. Her continual complaint is about her ex-husband: he is making her life miserable, he has always been unfair to her, he never pays child support. Also, her son is turning against her and accusing her of being selfish . . . and on . . . and on . . . and on. Is she taking responsibility for her experience of life? Absolutely not!<br class="calibre4"/>客观来说，玛拉坐在世界之巅。她有一份很棒的工作，住在一个漂亮的公寓里，有很多朋友和情人。她不断地抱怨她的前夫: 他使她的生活很痛苦，他总是对她不公平，他从不支付子女抚养费。而且，她的儿子也开始反对她，指责她太自私，一而再，再而三。她对自己的人生经历负责吗？当然不是！</p>
<p class="calibre9">I know many single or divorced people who are constantly complaining about their ex-husbands or their ex-wives, their bosses, their loneliness, the lousy singles scene, and so on. I know many married people who are constantly lamenting about their children, their lack of money, their lack of communication with their spouses, and so on. Are any of them really taking responsibility for their experience of life? Not at all!<br class="calibre4"/>我知道许多单身或离婚的人经常抱怨他们的前夫或前妻，他们的老板，他们的孤独，糟糕的单身场景，等等。我知道很多已婚人士经常抱怨他们的孩子，他们缺钱，他们缺乏与配偶的沟通等等。他们中的任何一个人真的对自己的生活经历负责吗？完全没有！</p>
<p class="calibre9">They are all, in some way, playing the role of victim. They have given their power to someone or something else. Keep in mind that when you give away your power, you move farther and farther to the left side of the Pain-to-Power Chart, and as a result you become paralyzed in your attempts to deal with fear.<br class="calibre4"/>他们都在某种程度上扮演着受害者的角色。他们把自己的力量给了别人或别的什么东西。请记住，当你放弃你的力量时，你会越来越靠近痛苦到力量图的左侧，结果你会在试图应对恐惧的过程中变得麻痹。</p>
<p class="calibre9">On a more obvious level, if you’re in a job you hate, if you’re single and you want to be married, if you’re in a lousy relationship and want to get out, if your daughter is making you gray before your time, and if, generally speaking, nothing seems to go the way you want it to go, you are also playing the role of victim. No wonder you feel fearful—victims are powerless!<br class="calibre4"/>在一个更明显的层面上，如果你做着一份你讨厌的工作，如果你单身并且想要结婚，如果你处于一段糟糕的关系中并且想要离开，如果你的女儿在你的时代之前使你变得灰白，如果，一般来说，没有什么事情是你想要的，你也在扮演一个受害者的角色。难怪你会感到害怕——受害者是无能为力的！</p>
<p class="calibre9"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">THE TRUTH IS THAT YOU REALLY ARE IN CONTROL—IN TOTAL CONTROL.</strong> For some reason, you are consciously or unconsciously choosing to be in that lousy job, you are choosing to hate the single life, you are choosing to stay in a destructive relationship, you are choosing to let your daughter drive you crazy, you are choosing to sabotage anything good in your life . . . or whatever else it may be for you. I know it is difficult to accept the fact that you are the cause of the feelings that take away your joy in life. It is very upsetting when you begin to see yourself as your own worst enemy. On the other hand, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">this realization is your biggest blessing.</em> If you know you can create your own misery, it stands to reason that you can also create your own joy.<br class="calibre4"/>事实是，你真的在控制之中，完全在控制之中。出于某种原因，你有意识或无意识地选择做那份糟糕的工作，你选择憎恨单身生活，你选择维持一段破坏性的关系，你选择让你的女儿把你逼疯，你选择破坏你生活中任何美好的东西，或者任何对你有利的东西。我知道很难接受这样一个事实: 你是那些夺走你生活快乐的感觉的原因。当你开始把自己看作是自己最大的敌人时，这是非常令人沮丧的。另一方面，这种认识是你最大的福气。如果你知道你可以创造自己的痛苦，那么理所当然的，你也可以创造自己的快乐。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Since taking responsibility for your experience of life is an elusive concept, I will explain the components of a more powerful way of living. Note that I have been careful not to ask you to believe that you are responsible for all your experiences <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">in</em> life (although there are some who would argue that you are). Rather, I ask you to believe that you are the cause of all your experiences <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">of</em> life, meaning that you are the cause of your <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">reactions</em> to everything that happens to you. There is a lot more about this in the next chapter and in chapter 9.<br class="calibre4"/>既然为自己的生活经历负责是一个难以捉摸的概念，我将解释一种更强大的生活方式的组成部分。请注意，我一直小心翼翼地不让你相信你对自己生活中的所有经历都负有责任(尽管有些人会认为你是)。相反，我请求你们相信你们是你们所有人生经历的起因，也就是说你们是你们对发生在你们身上的一切反应的起因。在下一章和第九章会有更多关于这个的内容。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As you read the following seven definitions of taking responsibility, keep remembering that whenever you are not taking responsibility, you put yourself in a position of pain, and hence decrease your ability to handle the fear in your life.<br class="calibre4"/>当你阅读以下关于承担责任的七个定义时，请记住，无论何时你不承担责任，你都会将自己置于痛苦的境地，从而降低你处理生活中恐惧的能力。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">1. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Taking responsibility means never blaming anyone else for anything you are being, doing, having, or feeling.</em> “Never?” you say. “But this time it really <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">is</em> his fault” (or her fault, or the boss’s fault, or my son’s fault, or the economy’s fault, or my mother’s fault, or my father’s fault, or my friend’s fault!). “Really, it is!” If I missed anyone or anything, just add it to the list. Until you fully understand that <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">you,</em> and no one else, create what goes on in your head, you will never be in control of your life. Here are a few scenarios I’ve heard in my classes and the questions these individuals had to ask themselves before they were able to move to a more powerful place.<br class="calibre4"/>1.承担责任意味着永远不要因为你正在做的、正在做的、正在拥有的或者正在感受的任何事情而责备任何人。“从不?”你说。“但这次真的是他的错”(或者她的错，或者老板的错，或者我儿子的错，或者经济的错，或者我母亲的错，或者我父亲的错，或者我朋友的错!).“真的是这样!”如果我错过了任何人或任何事，就把它添加到列表中。除非你完全理解你自己，而不是其他任何人，创造出你脑中的想法，否则你永远无法掌控自己的生活。以下是我在课堂上听到的一些场景，以及这些人在进入一个更强大的职位之前必须问自己的问题。</p>

<p class="spaceabove1"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Why did you choose to stay? Why couldn’t you take in any of the nice things he did for you instead of only finding fault? Why are you so filled with anger that he finds it impossible to communicate with you?</em>
<br class="calibre4"/>
你为什么选择留下来？为什么你不能接受他为你做的任何一件好事，而只是挑毛病？为什么你如此愤怒以至于他无法与你沟通？

<p class="calibre9"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Why didn’t you believe that he would find his own way? Why did you always need to rescue him? Why did you make him so much an extension of yourself that you expected too much from him? Why couldn’t you just let him be who he is?</em>
<br class="calibre4"/>
你为什么不相信他会找到自己的路？为什么你总是要去救他？为什么你让他成为你自己的延伸，以至于你对他期望过高？你为什么就不能让他做他自己呢？

<p class="calibre9">“Well, it certainly is the fault of the job market that I’m stuck in this lousy job.”<br class="calibre4"/>“嗯，我被困在这份糟糕的工作中，肯定是就业市场的错。”</p>
<p class="spaceabove1"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Why can’t you see that others are finding jobs even if the job market is so poor? Why are you not creating more satisfaction in the job you already have? Why aren’t you even trying to find a new job? Why are you not asking for what you want in the job you are already in, instead of constantly complaining that nothing is right? Why aren’t you committed to doing the best you can do?</em>
<br class="calibre4"/>
即使就业市场如此低迷，你为什么看不到其他人也在找工作呢？为什么你不能在现有的工作中创造更多的满足感？为什么你甚至不去尝试找一份新的工作？为什么你不在现有的工作中要求自己想要的东西，而是不断地抱怨什么都不对？为什么你不致力于尽你所能做到最好？

<p class="spaceabove1"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Why haven’t you noticed that others with children are going ahead with their careers, and that their children are doing fine? Why haven’t you taken up your husband’s offer to help you with the kids if you want to work? Why haven’t you made any effort to gain some skills that would really help you get a job you would love?</em>
<br class="calibre4"/>
为什么你没有注意到其他有孩子的人都在继续他们的事业，他们的孩子也做得很好？如果你想工作，为什么不接受丈夫的建议，帮助你照顾孩子呢？为什么你没有努力学习一些能真正帮助你找到一份你喜欢的工作的技能呢？
</p>
<p class="noindent1">If you are feeling some pain from identifying with any of the stories above, good. It simply pinpoints an area on which you have to work. The point to remember is that when you blame any outside force for any of your experience of life, you are literally giving away all your power and thus creating pain, paralysis and depression.<br class="calibre4"/>如果你因为认同上述任何一个故事而感到一些痛苦，那就好。它只是指出了一个你必须努力的领域。要记住的一点是，当你把你的生活经历归咎于任何外部力量时，你实际上是在放弃你所有的力量，从而制造痛苦、瘫痪和抑郁。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">2. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Taking responsibility means not blaming yourself.</em> I know this sounds contradictory, but it is not. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Anything</em> that takes away your power or your pleasure makes you a victim. Don’t make yourself a victim of yourself!<br class="calibre4"/>2.承担责任意味着不要责备自己。我知道这听起来自相矛盾，但事实并非如此。任何夺走你力量和快乐的东西都会让你成为受害者。不要让自己成为自己的受害者！</p>
<p class="calibre9">For some, this is more difficult than not blaming others. Once you’ve become aware that you have created so much of your unhappiness, you may have a tendency to punish yourself and put yourself down. “There I am messing up my life again. I’m hopeless. When will I ever learn?”<br class="calibre4"/>对于一些人来说，这比不责备他人更难。一旦你意识到你已经制造了如此多的不快乐，你可能会有惩罚自己和贬低自己的倾向。我又一次把我的生活搞得一团糟。我绝望了。我什么时候才能学会?”</p>
<p class="calibre9">This, again, is not taking responsibility for your experience of life. It is important to understand that you have always done the best you possibly could, given the person you were at any particular time. Now that you are learning a new way of thinking, you can begin to perceive things differently and possibly change many of your actions. There is absolutely no need to be upset with your past, present, or future behavior. It is all simply part of the learning process—the process of moving yourself from pain to power. And it takes time. You must be patient with yourself. There is <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">never</em> any need to be down on yourself. Nothing is your “fault.” Yes, you cause your unhappiness, but this is no reason to cast blame. You’re simply on the path toward greater self-fulfillment, and it is a lengthy process of trial and error.<br class="calibre4"/>再次强调，这不是对你的生活经历负责。重要的是要明白，你总是尽可能做到最好，在任何特定的时间你是一个人。现在你正在学习一种新的思维方式，你可以开始用不同的方式看待事物，并且可能改变你的许多行为。完全没有必要对你的过去、现在或者将来的行为感到沮丧。这仅仅是学习过程的一部分——将你自己从痛苦转变为力量的过程。这需要时间。你必须对自己有耐心。没有任何必要对自己失望。没有什么是你的“错”是的，你导致了你的不快乐，但是这不是责备的理由。你只是在通往更大的自我实现的道路上，这是一个漫长的尝试和错误的过程。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">3. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Taking responsibility means being aware of where and when you are NOT taking responsibility so that you can eventually change.</em> It took years before I realized that the place I played the victim role most often was with the men in my life. I remember many evenings of complaining for countless hours with my girlfriends about the grief the men in my life were causing me.<br class="calibre4"/>3.承担责任意味着意识到你在何时何地没有承担责任，这样你最终可以改变。我花了很多年才意识到，我扮演的受害者角色最常出现在我生活中的男人身上。我记得很多个晚上，我和我的女朋友们抱怨了无数个小时，抱怨我生命中的男人们给我带来的悲伤。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Those “jerks,” as I so self-righteously called them, were always doing something to take away my happiness. One was always late, one was incredibly stingy, one didn’t make enough money, one loved to play golf too much, one wouldn’t get a divorce, and so on. I was able to build up incredible anger and resentment about them. Hours and hours on the phone of “Would you believe he actually . . . ” Naturally, my loyal friends shared my drama as I shared their upsets about their men. It was a Moan and Groan Society. We never seemed to tire of each other’s stories. No wonder: we fed each other the martyrdom we were obviously enjoying, and we always got to be right! The payoff was that we didn’t have to create our own happiness—we could simply blame men for not giving it to us.<br class="calibre4"/>那些“混蛋”，就像我自以为是地称呼他们的那样，总是在做一些事情夺走我的幸福。一个人总是迟到，一个人非常吝啬，一个人赚不到足够的钱，一个人太喜欢打高尔夫，一个人不愿意离婚，等等。我能够对他们建立难以置信的愤怒和怨恨。一个小时又一个小时的电话“你能相信他真的... ...”自然地，我忠实的朋友们分享了我的戏剧，我也分享了他们对他们男人的不满。这是一个呻吟和呻吟的社会。我们似乎从不厌倦彼此的故事。毫无疑问: 我们给彼此提供了我们显然很享受的牺牲，而且我们总是对的！结果是，我们不必创造自己的幸福——我们可以简单地责怪男人没有给我们幸福。</p>
<p class="calibre9">During this time I was certain I was taking responsibility for my life. Just like my friend Mara, I was making a wonderful living, I had a great apartment, I was totally “independent.” But I <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">wasn’t</em> taking responsibility for my life. I was still expecting the men in my life to “make me happy.” I finally learned there is really only one person in the world who can make me happy, and that is ME! Ironically, only through this realization was I able, for the first time, to have a wonderfully nurturing relationship.<br class="calibre4"/>在这段时间里，我确信我对自己的生活负有责任。就像我的朋友玛拉一样，我过着美好的生活，我有一个很棒的公寓，我完全“独立”但我没有对自己的生活负责。我仍然期望我生命中的男人能“让我快乐”我终于知道世界上真的只有一个人能让我快乐，那就是我！具有讽刺意味的是，只有通过这种认识，我才能够，第一次，有一个奇妙的养育关系。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Now I know that when I am angry at my husband, I simply have to ask myself, “What am I not doing in my life that I could be doing that I am blaming him for not doing for me?” (Read that one again!) I am now quickly able to tune into what it is. Either I’m being obsessive about money, or I’m feeling insecure, or I’m not creating enough activity for myself, or I’m expecting him to make “all better” something I’m not handling, or whatever.<br class="calibre4"/>现在我知道当我对我丈夫生气的时候，我只需要问问自己，“我这一生中有什么是我不能做的，我却责怪他没有为我做的?”(再读一遍我现在很快就能理解它是什么了。要么是我对金钱过于执着，要么是我感到不安全，要么是我没有为自己创造足够的活动，要么是我期望他能让我无法处理的事情变得“一切都好”，或者别的什么。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Once I realize what I am doing, I can get into the task of correcting it. As I correct what needs to be handled in my life, all my anger toward others disappears. My daughter, Leslie, recently commented on how fantastic my marriage is. “Yes,” I said, “it’s amazing how perfect Mark becomes when I stop expecting him to handle my life!”<br class="calibre4"/>一旦我意识到我在做什么，我就可以开始纠正它。当我纠正生活中需要处理的事情时，我对他人的所有愤怒都消失了。我的女儿 Leslie 最近评论说我的婚姻是多么美好。“是的,”我说，“当我不再期待马克能掌控我的生活时，他变得多么完美，这真是令人惊讶!”</p>
<p class="calibre9">This is not to say that you aren’t entitled to have your basic needs met by your partner—the need to be supported in your growth, the need to be nurtured at times, the need to know there is caring on your spouse’s part—but when you are not handling your life, no amount of caring and nurturing is enough. You become a bottomless pit. The man in your life could stand on his head for you, as some of the men in my life tried to do, but it is never enough.<br class="calibre4"/>这并不是说你没有权利让你的伴侣满足你的基本需求——在你成长过程中需要支持，需要时不时地被培养，需要知道你的伴侣在关心你——但是当你不处理你的生活时，再多的关心和培养都不够。你会变成一个无底洞。你生命中的男人可以为你倒立，就像我生命中的一些男人试图做的那样，但这永远都不够。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I might add that if someone is not supplying your basic needs to be nurtured and loved, certainly you would serve yourself by leaving. But first you must ask yourself, “Is it that (s)he is so terrible, or is it simply that I am not taking responsibility for my experience of life?” If you are satisfied that you simply do not choose to spend your life with this person, then it is also taking responsibility to move on with the intention of finding a more compatible partner.<br class="calibre4"/>我还要补充一句，如果有人不能满足你需要被培养和爱的基本需求，你肯定会离开为自己服务。但首先你必须问问自己，“是因为他太可怕了，还是仅仅因为我没有为自己的人生经历负责?”如果你对自己没有选择与这个人共度一生感到满意，那么你也应该承担责任，继续寻找一个更加和谐的伴侣。</p>
<p class="calibre9">One clue that you are truly taking responsibility is when you feel little or no anger toward this person. You realize that you chose to be there in the past and you are now choosing to leave. Nothing is the other’s fault. (S)he is doing the best (s)he can given her (his) level of personal growth. Anger is your clue that you are not taking responsibility.<br class="calibre4"/>你真正承担责任的一个线索是，当你对这个人很少或根本不生气的时候。你意识到你过去选择留在那里，现在你选择离开。没有什么是别人的错。他正在尽他所能给予她(他)个人成长的水平。愤怒是你没有承担责任的线索。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Relationship with another is only one area where you can give away your power. It is important to look at all other areas of your life as well, to determine where you are not taking responsibility. Your clue will be any one of the following signs:<br class="calibre4"/>与他人的关系只是你可以放弃自己权力的一个方面。同样重要的是看看你生活中的其他方面，确定你在哪些方面没有承担责任。你的线索可能是以下任何一个迹象:</p>
<p class="spaceabove2">anger<br class="calibre4"/>愤怒</p>
<p class="doubleindent">impatience<br class="calibre4"/>不耐烦</p>
<p class="doubleindent">upset<br class="calibre4"/>心烦意乱</p>

<p class="doubleindent">constant state of limbo<br class="calibre4"/>一直处于游离状态</p>
<p class="doubleindent">jealousy<br class="calibre4"/>嫉妒</p>
<p class="noindent1">This is not a complete list, but you get the idea. Whenever you feel any of these, determine what <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">you</em> are not doing in your life that is causing the telltale sign. You will be surprised how easy it is to locate where you are abdicating responsibility.<br class="calibre4"/>这不是一个完整的清单，但是你已经明白了。无论你什么时候感觉到这些，确定你在生活中没有做的事情是导致这些迹象的原因。你会惊讶地发现，你放弃责任的地方是多么容易。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">4. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Taking responsibility means handling the Chatterbox.</em> This is the little voice inside, the voice that tries to drive you crazy— and often succeeds! I’ll bet some of you don’t even know it’s there (I was shocked when I became aware of it), but I promise you it holds the key to all your fears. It’s the voice that heralds doom, lack, and losing. We’re so used to its presence we often don’t even notice it is talking to us. If you are not aware of your Chatterbox, it sounds something like this:<br class="calibre4"/>4.承担责任意味着处理喋喋不休的人。这是你内心的一个小声音，一个试图让你发疯的声音——而且经常成功！我敢打赌你们中的一些人甚至不知道它的存在(当我意识到它的时候我很震惊) ，但是我向你们保证它是你们所有恐惧的关键。它预示着厄运、匮乏和失败。我们如此习惯于它的存在，以至于我们常常没有注意到它正在对我们说话。如果你没有意识到你的 Chatterbox，它听起来是这样的:</p>

I wonder if it was because he heard I went out with Allen the other night. Well, I don’t think he should expect me to sit home every night and wait for him to call. He has a lot of nerve if he expects that. The next time I see him I’ll ask him why he hasn’t called. We were supposed to go to the movies this week, and he didn’t even remember.

简
</p>
<p class="calibre9">Jean was feeling horribly stuck in her job and wanted desperately to get out. She viewed herself as a victim. Poor Jean! Her Chatterbox constantly played the “if only” game. If only the job market were a little better, she wouldn’t have a problem. If only she had better skills, there would be more opportunity. What was really keeping Jean at her job? What were the payoffs?<br class="calibre4"/>简觉得自己被工作困住了，非常想离开这里。她认为自己是一个受害者。可怜的简！她的话匣子经常玩“如果”的游戏。如果就业市场稍微好一点，她就不会有问题了。只要技术好一点，就会有更多的机会。到底是什么让 Jean 留在了这个位置上？收益是什么？</p>
<p class="calibre9">By remaining a victim, Jean had clearly become comfortable. She didn’t have to face possible rejection in her search for a new job. Although she hated her job, it was easy. She knew she could handle it; she didn’t have to question her competence. She put in her hours and didn’t have to expend any additional energy. And the job was relatively secure.<br class="calibre4"/>作为一个受害者，Jean 显然已经变得很舒服了。在寻找新工作的过程中，她不必面对可能的拒绝。尽管她讨厌她的工作，但是这份工作很简单。她知道自己可以胜任这份工作，她不必怀疑自己的能力。她投入了自己的时间，不需要花费任何额外的精力。这份工作相对稳定。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Once Jean became aware of all her payoffs, she had at least three choices. The first was to stay where she was and continue to be miserable. The second was to stay where she was and choose to enjoy her job. The third was to choose to find a more satisfying job.<br class="calibre4"/>一旦 Jean 意识到她所有的收益，她至少有三个选择。第一个选择是呆在原地，继续痛苦下去。第二种是待在原地，选择享受她的工作。第三是选择找一份更令人满意的工作。</p>
<p class="calibre9">What did she ultimately do? After recognizing the payoffs for what they were, she was able to break away and find a new job. As long as she was in the victim mode, she was stuck. As soon as she realized she was choosing to stay because of the payoffs, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">and not because of her “if only”s,</em> she was able to move.<br class="calibre4"/>她最终做了什么？在认识到回报是什么之后，她能够离开并找到一份新的工作。只要她还处于受害者模式，她就陷入了困境。一旦她意识到她选择留下是因为收益，而不是因为她的“如果”，她就可以搬家了。</p>

凯文
</p>
<p class="calibre9">Kevin had been separated from his wife for five years. Although he had found someone else he wanted to marry, he was not able to tell his wife and children that he wanted a divorce. When the new woman threatened to leave, he sought professional help. The “victim” story his Chatterbox was telling him was that his wife would kill herself, his children would never talk to him again, and his parents would disown him. Poor Kevin! He really believed all this on a conscious level and was paralyzed with guilt.<br class="calibre4"/>凯文已经和他的妻子分居五年了。虽然他已经找到了另一个他想要结婚的人，但是他不能告诉他的妻子和孩子他想要离婚。当这个新女人威胁要离开时，他寻求了专业的帮助。他的话匣子告诉他的“受害者”故事是，他的妻子会自杀，他的孩子再也不会和他说话，他的父母会和他断绝关系。可怜的凯文！他真的在意识层面上相信了这一切，内疚使他瘫痪了。</p>
<p class="calibre9">With the help of a therapist, it did not take him long to see that the real problem was his own fear of letting go. Though he no longer loved his wife, she unconsciously represented a psychological “place to come home to,” and he was frightened to sever the tie permanently. That was his payoff for staying stuck.<br class="calibre4"/>在治疗师的帮助下，他很快就发现真正的问题是他自己害怕放手。虽然他不再爱他的妻子，但她在不知不觉中代表了一个心理上的“回家的地方”，他害怕永远断绝这种关系。这就是他停滞不前的代价。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As soon as Kevin was able to see that his own irrational fear was stopping him, he immediately started proceedings to divorce his wife. Naturally, his wife did not kill herself, his children never stopped talking to him, and his parents didn’t disown him. They wondered what had taken him so long! The point is that once he recognized that his payoffs were the reason he was choosing to remain in the marriage, his guilt disappeared and he was able to take action.<br class="calibre4"/>凯文一看到自己无理性的恐惧阻止了他，就立刻开始了与妻子离婚的程序。当然，他的妻子并没有自杀，他的孩子从来没有停止和他说话，他的父母也没有和他断绝关系。他们想知道他为什么花了这么长时间！重点是，一旦他意识到他的收益是他选择继续维持婚姻的原因，他的罪恶感就消失了，他可以采取行动了。</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Tanya</em>
<br class="calibre4"/>
Tanya
</p>
<p class="calibre9">Tanya was always sick, which interfered greatly with many of the things she wanted to do in life. She truly saw herself as a “poor thing” endowed with an unhealthy body. A full-fledged victim if you ever saw one! In one of my workshops, I asked the group to list the payoffs for staying “stuck” in whatever it was that was bothering them. Tanya could find no payoffs for being sick all the time . . . until the group helped her out.<br class="calibre4"/>坦尼娅总是生病，这严重影响了她生活中许多想做的事情。她真的认为自己是一个被赋予了不健康身体的“可怜的人”。一个成熟的受害者，如果你曾经看到过的话！在我的一个研讨会上，我要求小组列出让他们“陷入”困扰他们的任何事情的回报。坦尼娅找不到一直生病的回报，直到这个小组帮助了她。</p>
<p class="calibre9">They pointed out to her that her illness got her a lot of attention and that it kept her from having to put herself out there in the world and take any risks. She denied it at first, but finally was able to acknowledge that there was some truth in what they were saying.<br class="calibre4"/>他们向她指出，她的病让她得到了很多关注，这使她不必把自己放在世界上，不必冒任何风险。起初，她否认了这一点，但最终还是能够承认他们所说的话中有一部分是真的。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Tanya had never looked at her unhealthiness as manipulation, though her unconscious knew exactly what it was doing. As a child, illness was the only device that got her any attention. Tanya’s awareness of the payoffs was the impetus she needed to turn her life around. Realizing that she was possibly <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">creating</em> her ill health, she made a lot of changes in her life.<br class="calibre4"/>坦尼娅从来没有把自己的不健康看作是一种操纵，尽管她的潜意识知道自己在做什么。作为一个孩子，疾病是唯一能引起她注意的手段。Tanya 对回报的意识是她改变生活的动力。意识到她可能正在制造自己的不良健康状况，她对自己的生活做出了很多改变。</p>
<p class="calibre9">First, she completely changed her diet and joined a health club. As important—perhaps more so—she asked the significant others in her life to help her by “rewarding” her only when she was well and ignoring her when she was sick. They obliged after a little practice. She began creating work goals for herself and pushing herself to meet them, even when she was sick. She began doing many of the positive exercises in this book—such as using affirmations and inspirational audios.<br class="calibre4"/>首先，她彻底改变了饮食习惯，加入了一个健康俱乐部。同样重要的是——也许更重要的是——她请求生命中重要的其他人帮助她，只在她身体好的时候“奖励”她，在她生病的时候忽视她。经过一段时间的练习，他们就答应了。她开始为自己设定工作目标，并强迫自己去实现它们，即使是在她生病的时候。她开始在这本书中做许多积极的练习——比如使用自我肯定和鼓舞人心的音频。</p>
<p class="calibre9">When she fully realized her payoffs for being ill, Tanya was able to choose: Did she want to get attention for being sick all her life, or did she want to find a more satisfying way of relating to people and to her life goals? Did she always want to be an observer of life rather than a participant? She chose the latter . . . and sickness is no longer an issue in her life.<br class="calibre4"/>当她完全意识到生病的好处时，Tanya 可以选择: 她是想因为生病一辈子而得到关注，还是想找到一种更令人满意的方式来与人交往和实现她的人生目标？她总是想成为生活的观察者而不是参与者吗？她选择了后者... ... 疾病不再是她生活中的一个问题。</p>
<p class="calibre9">From these case studies, you can see the power that hidden payoffs can have in our lives. They are not difficult to discover once you realize they exist. It’s simply a matter of sitting down with a pencil and paper and listing them. Sometimes they are obvious to others, but masked from your own vision. If you can’t find them, ask a friend to help. You might be surprised to discover that your friends know more about your motives than you do.<br class="calibre4"/>从这些案例研究中，你可以看到隐性收益在我们生活中的作用。一旦你意识到它们的存在，你就不难发现它们。这只是一个简单的问题，坐下来用铅笔和纸，并列出他们。有时候它们对别人来说是显而易见的，但是对你自己来说却是隐藏的。如果你找不到他们，请求朋友的帮助。你可能会惊讶地发现，你的朋友比你更了解你的动机。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">6. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Taking responsibility means figuring out what you want in life and acting on it.</em> Set your goals—then go out and work toward them.<br class="calibre4"/>6.承担责任意味着弄清楚你在生活中想要什么并付诸行动。设定你的目标——然后走出去，朝着它们努力。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Figure out what kind of space you would like to live in . . . then create it. It doesn’t take a lot of money to create a peaceful, loving home for yourself.<br class="calibre4"/>找出你想要居住的空间，然后创造它。为自己创造一个宁静、充满爱的家并不需要花很多钱。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Look around and see who you would love to include in your circle of friends . . . then pick up the phone and make plans to get together. Don’t sit around waiting for them to call you.<br class="calibre4"/>环顾四周，看看你希望哪些人加入你的朋友圈... ... 然后拿起电话，制定一个聚会的计划。不要坐等他们打电话给你。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Check out your body. Determine what you need to do to create what looks and feels healthy . . . then make it happen.<br class="calibre4"/>看看你的身材。确定你需要做些什么来创造看起来和感觉上健康的东西，然后让它发生。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Most of us do not “sculpt” our lives. We accept what comes our way . . . then we gripe about it. Many of us spend our lives waiting—waiting for the perfect mate, waiting for the perfect job, waiting for the perfect friends to come along. There is no need to wait for anyone to give you anything in your life. You have the power to create what you need. Given commitment, clear goals, and action, it’s just a matter of time.<br class="calibre4"/>我们中的大多数人不会“塑造”我们的生活。我们接受一切，然后抱怨。我们中的许多人一生都在等待——等待完美的伴侣，等待完美的工作，等待完美的朋友的到来。在你的生活中，没有必要等待别人给你任何东西。你有能力去创造你所需要的。有了承诺，明确的目标和行动，这只是时间问题。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">7. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Taking responsibility means being aware of the multitude of choices you have in any given situation.</em><br class="calibre4"/>7. 承担责任意味着意识到在任何特定情况下你有多种选择。</p>
<p class="calibre9">One of my students put it this way: “From the time my alarm clock rings, I have an hour and a half alone and I realize it’s all up to me what the day is going to start like. It’s up to me whether I’m going to open the shades and let the light in or mess around in the dark. It’s my choice to lie in bed and say ‘Yuck, I don’t want to get up and go to work. I didn’t finish the report I’m supposed to have ready today.’ Or it’s my choice to lie in bed and give myself positive self-talk and look forward to the coming day. It’s my choice to put the music on, dance around the apartment instead of putting on the negativity of the news or listening to my negative Chatterbox . . . . It’s up to me whether I’m going to worry about how my body is not in shape or whether I’m going to tell myself I am in the process of creating a great body. The whole day is up to me!”<br class="calibre4"/>我的一个学生是这样说的: “从我的闹钟响起的那一刻起，我有一个半小时的独处时间，我意识到一天的开始是什么样子完全取决于我自己。这取决于我是打开窗帘，让光线照进来，还是在黑暗中胡闹。我可以选择躺在床上说‘呸，我不想起床去上班。我没有完成今天应该准备好的报告。或者我可以选择躺在床上，给自己一个积极的自我对话，期待明天的到来。这是我的选择，打开音乐，在公寓里跳舞而不是播放消极的新闻或者听我消极的话匣子。这取决于我是否会担心我的身体状况不佳或者我是否会告诉自己我正在创造一个伟大的身体。一整天都取决于我自己!”</p>
<p class="calibre9">As you go through each day, it is important to realize that at every moment you are choosing the way you feel. When a difficult situation comes into your life, it is possible to tune in to your mind and say, “Okay, choose.” Are you going to make yourself miserable or content? Are you going to visualize scarcity or abundance? Are you going to put yourself down for getting angry with your husband or are you simply going to notice what insecurity you were feeling at the time and discuss it with him? The choice is definitely yours. Pick the one that contributes most to your aliveness and growth.<br class="calibre4"/>当你度过每一天的时候，重要的是要意识到在每一个时刻你都在选择你感觉的方式。当一个困难的情况出现在你的生活中，你可以调整你的思维，说，“好吧，选择。”你打算让自己痛苦还是满足？你会想象匮乏还是富足？你会因为生你丈夫的气而贬低自己，还是仅仅注意到自己当时的不安全感，并与他讨论这个问题？这个选择肯定是你的。选择那个对你的活力和成长贡献最大的。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Here are some other kinds of choices:<br class="calibre4"/>下面是一些其他的选择:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre6">
<p class="noindent">Your friend decides not to go with you on the trip you had planned together. You’re really angry . . . . OR . . . You understand she has her reasons, and you find someone else to share the trip, or you go alone and have a ball!<br class="calibre4"/>你的朋友决定不和你一起去参加你们计划的旅行。你真的很生气。手术室... 你知道她有她的理由，你找别人来分享这次旅行，或者你一个人去，玩个痛快！</p>

</blockquote>
<p class="calibre9">By now you can really see that the choice is yours. As you continue to read, you will further your ability to place yourself on the upside of any given situation. Keep in mind that this way of thinking doesn’t excuse inappropriate behavior on the part of others in your life. It simply allows you to have a more satisfying life. Fully taking responsibility for your experience of life is a long process that requires much practice. I’m still working on it daily after many years . . . and each day my life gets better and better and better. The point is simply to begin. You will start to feel better immediately.<br class="calibre4"/>现在你可以看到选择权在你手上。当你继续阅读的时候，你会进一步提高自己的能力，让自己在任何给定的情况下都处于优势地位。请记住，这种思考方式不能成为你生活中其他人不恰当行为的借口。它只是让你有一个更满意的生活。对自己的人生经历负全部责任是一个需要大量练习的漫长过程。许多年过去了，我仍然每天都在努力。我的生活一天比一天好。重点仅仅是开始。你马上就会感觉好多了。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">The following six exercises will help you feel noticeably more powerful in the face of your fears:<br class="calibre4"/>下面的六个练习将帮助你在面对恐惧时感觉更加强大:</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">1. List all the payoffs you get from staying stuck in some aspect of your life. What don’t you have to face? What don’t you have to do? What comfort do you get? What image do you get to hold onto? Be as honest with yourself as you possibly can. When you are aware of what you are doing, you will automatically discard a lot of your robotlike behavior. You will lead yourself instead of being led.<br class="calibre4"/>1.列出你停留在生活的某个方面所得到的所有回报。你不必面对什么？你不需要做什么？你能得到什么安慰？你能坚持什么样的形象？尽可能的对自己诚实。当你意识到自己在做什么的时候，你会自动抛弃许多机器人般的行为。你会引导你自己而不是被引导。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">2. Be aware of all the options you have during the course of a given day. When you are confronted with a difficult situation, sit down and write in a notebook all the possible ways you can act and feel about it. Close your eyes and picture yourself happy about it . . . then sad about it . . . then outrageous . . . then humorous . . . then heavy . . . then light . . . and so on. You will begin to see how easy it is to change your point of view—hence, your feelings. You are in control.<br class="calibre4"/>2.在给定的一天里，要意识到你所有的选择。当你面对一个困难的情况，坐下来，在笔记本上写下所有可能的方法，你可以采取行动和感受它。闭上眼睛，想象自己为此感到高兴，然后为此感到悲伤，然后是蛮横，然后是幽默，然后是沉重，然后是轻松，等等。你会开始看到改变你的观点是多么容易——因此，你的感觉。你可以控制自己。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Each time you are upset, be conscious of the alternatives available to you. Again, make it a game. In no way should you put yourself down for being upset. It’s a great clue as to where you need to begin taking responsibility.<br class="calibre4"/>每次你不开心的时候，意识到你可以有其他的选择。再一次，把它变成一个游戏。千万不要因为自己不开心而贬低自己。这是一个很好的线索，告诉你应该从哪里开始承担责任。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">3. Start noticing what you say in conversations with friends. See if it includes a lot of complaining about other people, such as, “Would you believe that Jill was late for dinner again? We had the biggest fight—right in the restaurant.” If this sounds familiar, see if you can turn the situation around so that you learn something new about yourself. For example, “I notice that when Jill is late, I begin to feel really angry. I wonder why I feel that way? I think it’s because she doesn’t seem to have any respect for my time. On the other hand, part of me likes it. It makes me feel superior to always have something to gripe about . . . .”<br class="calibre4"/>3.开始注意你在和朋友交谈时说的话。看看它是否包括许多关于其他人的抱怨，例如，“你会相信吉尔晚餐又迟到了吗？我们在餐厅里大吵了一架。”如果这听起来很熟悉，看看你能不能扭转局面，这样你就能对自己有新的认识。例如，“我注意到吉尔迟到的时候，我开始感到非常生气。我想知道为什么我会这样？我想是因为她似乎不尊重我的时间。另一方面，我也有点喜欢。总是抱怨让我觉得高人一等... ...”</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">4. In a notebook, list the many choices available to you that can change presently upsetting experiences into positive ones. Using the example of Jill’s lateness, what choices could you make?<br class="calibre4"/>4.在笔记本上列出许多你可以选择的方法，这些方法可以把当前的烦恼转变成积极的经历。以 Jill 的迟到为例，你能做出什么样的选择？</p>
<p class="calibre9">You could stop meeting with her; arrive later, knowing she will be late; bring some interesting reading material; relax. If meeting on time is essential, you could simply tell her that if she is not there by an agreed-upon hour, you will not wait. There is no reason for anger.<br class="calibre4"/>你可以停止和她见面; 晚一点到，知道她会迟到; 带一些有趣的阅读材料; 放松。如果准时见面是必要的，你可以简单地告诉她，如果她没有在约定的时间到达，你不会等她。没有理由生气。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The key is not to blame others for your being upset. This is not to condone the behavior of others, but simply not to allow it to be the source of your upset.<br class="calibre4"/>关键是不要因为自己的不安而责怪别人。这不是宽恕他人的行为，而只是不允许它成为你心烦意乱的根源。</p>
<p class="calibre9">In every situation there are at least thirty ways to change your point of view. Make this another game—the “change your point of view” game. Play it with a friend; having a “growth buddy” is very nourishing.<br class="calibre4"/>在任何情况下，至少有30种方法可以改变你的观点。让这成为另一个游戏——“改变你的观点”游戏。和朋友一起玩; 有一个“成长伙伴”是非常有营养的。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">5. Begin to look at the gifts you have received from what you have always looked at as a “bad” situation. For example, if you are still hurting from your divorce, begin to focus on the good things you had during the marriage and the good things that have come about as a result of the divorce, such as new friends, new ways of dealing with money, freedom, less dependency.<br class="calibre4"/>5.开始看看你从那些你一直认为是“糟糕”的情况中得到的礼物。举个例子，如果你还在受离婚的伤害，开始关注你在婚姻中拥有的美好事物和离婚带来的美好事物，比如新朋友，处理金钱的新方法，自由，少依赖。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">6. This one is really tough! See if you can go one week without criticizing anyone or complaining about anything. You will be surprised how difficult this is. You will also be surprised to learn how much complaining and criticizing you do.<br class="calibre4"/>6.这个真的很难！看看你能不能坚持一周不批评任何人，不抱怨任何事。你会惊讶这是多么的困难。你也会惊讶地发现你有多少抱怨和批评。</p>
<p class="calibre9">By the way, when you ultimately stop putting down other people in your life, it may seem as if you have nothing left to talk about with your friends. Griping is a habit, and needs to be replaced by something more positive. This takes a bit of time and ingenuity, but it will be far more satisfying and joyful.<br class="calibre4"/>顺便说一句，当你最终停止贬低你生活中的其他人时，你可能会觉得你似乎没有什么可以和你的朋友谈论的了。抱怨是一种习惯，需要一些更积极的东西来代替。这需要一点时间和创造力，但它会更令人满意和快乐。</p>
