<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="drop">O</span>ne of the most valuable lessons in learning to diminish fear is embodied in the phrase <strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">SAY YES TO YOUR UNIVERSE.</strong> These words were casually uttered by Janet Zuckerman, a wonderful teacher of mine, to someone who was complaining bitterly about a particular circumstance in his life. I asked Janet exactly what she meant by that phrase, and she replied, “It’s simple. Whatever happens to you in life, just nod your head up and down, instead of shaking it side to side. Just say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> instead of <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no.</em>” Over the years I’ve incorporated this phrase into my life with magical results.<br class="calibre4"/>在学习如何减少恐惧的过程中，最有价值的一课就是对你的宇宙说“是”。这句话是珍妮特 · 祖克曼(Janet Zuckerman)随口说出的，她是我的一位出色的老师，当时她正在痛苦地抱怨自己生活中的某个特定情况。我问珍妮特这句话到底是什么意思，她回答说: “很简单。不管你生活中发生了什么，只需要上下点头，而不是左右摇晃。只要说“是”而不是“不是”这些年来，我把这句话融入了我的生活，产生了神奇的效果。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The term “universe” refers to that life plan that seems to take over despite what we have in mind—that “force” operating, seemingly on its own, that often interferes with our picture of how we would like things to be. It refers to a certain flow in our lives and the lives of others over which we have little or no control. So often when we are all set to move in a specific direction, an unexpected event changes everything. Those unexpected events or even the <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">possibility</em> of the unexpected sets us up for a great deal of fear. We anticipate the worst. It is important to remember:<br class="calibre4"/>“宇宙”这个术语指的是，尽管我们脑海中有这样一个生活计划，但它似乎还是接管了我们的生活——这种“力量”似乎是独立运作的，它经常干扰我们对事物如何发展的想象。它指的是我们生活中的某种流程，以及我们几乎无法或完全无法控制的其他人的生活。所以通常当我们都准备朝着一个特定的方向前进时，一个意想不到的事件改变了一切。那些意想不到的事件，甚至意想不到的可能性都会让我们感到恐惧。我们预测最坏的情况。重要的是要记住:</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">IN SAYING “YES” LIES THE ANTIDOTE TO OUR FEAR.</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
说“是”就是我们恐惧的解药。
</p>
<p class="noindent1">The phrase “say yes” means “to agree to” those things that life hands us. Saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> means letting go of resistance and letting in the possibilities that our universe offers in new ways of seeing the world. It means to relax bodily and calmly survey the situation, thereby reducing upset and anxiety. Aside from the emotional benefits, the physical benefits are enormous. Conversely, saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no</em> means to be a victim. “How could this happen to me!” Saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no</em> means to block, to fight, to resist opportunities for growth and challenge. Saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no</em> creates tension, exhaustion, wasted expenditure of energy, emotional upheaval—or, worse, it creates apathy. “I can’t cope. I can’t go on. There is no hope.” The truth of the matter is that saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> is our only hope.<br class="calibre4"/>短语“说是”的意思是“同意”生活给我们的东西。说“是”意味着放弃抵抗，让我们的宇宙以新的方式看待这个世界。它意味着放松身体，冷静地审视环境，从而减少烦恼和焦虑。除了情感上的好处，身体上的好处是巨大的。相反，说“不”意味着成为受害者。“这怎么会发生在我身上!”说“不”意味着去阻止，去战斗，去抵制成长和挑战的机会。说“不”会造成紧张、疲惫、浪费精力、情绪波动——或者更糟糕的是，会造成冷漠。我无法应付。我无法继续。没有希望了。”事实上，答应是我们唯一的希望。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Not only is saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> our antidote to dealing with day-today disappointments, rejections, and missed opportunities (the flu, a leaking roof, a traffic jam, a flat tire, a lousy date, and so on), <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">it is the miracle tool for dealing with our deepest, darkest fears.</em><br class="calibre4"/>说“是”不仅是我们应对日常失望、拒绝和错失机会(流感、漏水的屋顶、交通堵塞、爆胎、糟糕的约会等等)的解药，也是应对我们内心最深处、最黑暗的恐惧的神奇工具。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Let me tell you about Charles, whose presence in my life confirmed the power of saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to the universe. Charles grew up in poverty in a New York ghetto. His “tough guy” image served him well until he was severely handicapped by a gunshot wound incurred in a street fight. His spine was shattered, and he was paralyzed from the waist down.<br class="calibre4"/>让我告诉你查尔斯的故事，他在我生命中的出现证实了我对宇宙说好的能力。查尔斯在纽约贫民区的贫困中长大。他的“硬汉”形象让他受益匪浅，直到他在一次街头斗殴中受了严重的枪伤。他的脊椎骨折，腰部以下瘫痪。</p>
<p class="calibre9">When I met Charles, he had just completed training in a rehabilitation center and was looking for a job at The Floating Hospital. Charles wanted an opportunity to teach children how to avoid getting into trouble the way he had. He became part of my staff and an inspiration to everyone around him.<br class="calibre4"/>当我遇到查尔斯的时候，他刚刚在一家康复中心完成训练，正在浮动医院找工作。查尔斯想要一个教孩子们如何避免像他一样陷入麻烦的机会。他成为了我的员工，激励着他身边的每一个人。</p>
<p class="calibre9">One day I walked into one of our classrooms and found Charles sitting with a group of children surrounding him. He was answering all the burning questions that young people have when they look at a handicapped person. “What does it feel like not to be able to walk?” “What should I say to someone in a wheelchair?” “How do you go to the bathroom?” At one point, Charles asked the group what they thought a handicapped person wanted most. One little boy quickly answered, “Friends!” “Right!” answered Charles, and all the children spontaneously jumped up and hugged him, shouting, “I’ll be your friend!” I don’t know who got more out of the session— Charles, the children, or me.<br class="calibre4"/>一天，我走进我们的一间教室，发现查尔斯和一群孩子坐在一起。他正在回答年轻人看到残疾人时所有的尖锐问题。“不能走路是什么感觉?”“我应该对一个坐轮椅的人说什么?”“你怎么上厕所?”有一次，查尔斯问大家他们认为残疾人最想要的是什么。一个小男孩很快回答: “朋友!”“对!”查尔斯回答道，所有的孩子都自发地跳起来拥抱他，喊道: “我愿意做你的朋友!”我不知道是查尔斯，孩子们，还是我，从这次谈话中得到了更多的东西。</p>
<p class="calibre9">On another occasion, we were giving a party for a new group of senior citizens. Although we had hired a three-piece band for the festivities, the seniors were hesitant about getting into the swing of things. All of a sudden, Charles pushed his wheelchair into the middle of the room and started “dancing” with the music. “Come on, everyone. If I can get out here and dance, so can you.” Within minutes, he had everyone dancing, laughing, singing, and clapping. His spirit was infectious. The strangers in the room quickly became friends. He never missed the opportunity to show people that, with a positive attitude, value can be created from anything that happens to you in life.<br class="calibre4"/>还有一次，我们为一群新的老年人举办了一个聚会。虽然我们已经雇了一个三人乐队来参加庆祝活动，但是老人们还是犹豫不决。突然，查尔斯把他的轮椅推到房间中间，开始随着音乐“跳舞”。来吧，大家。如果我能出来跳舞，你们也能几分钟之内，他让每个人都跳舞，大笑，唱歌，鼓掌。他的精神很有感染力。房间里的陌生人很快就成了朋友。他从来没有错过向人们展示的机会，以一个积极的态度，价值可以创造任何发生在你生活中的事情。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I had many opportunities to talk with Charles. He told me that in the early days of his disability he had lost all hope, all will. As he described it, “It wasn’t easy for a macho kid to lose his ability to walk, let alone to lose all control of his bladder and bowels.” He was referred to an excellent rehabilitation center, but refused to be helped. The center was about to send him home to make way for someone who was willing to take responsibility for his own life. That was the turning point. Charles knew that if he was sent home, he would have no chance at all. This was his moment to say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> or <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no</em> to his universe. He is thankful he chose to say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes.</em><br class="calibre4"/>我有很多机会和查尔斯交谈。他告诉我，在他残疾的早期，他失去了所有的希望，所有的意志。正如他所描述的那样，“对于一个大男子主义的孩子来说，失去行走能力并不容易，更不用说失去对膀胱和肠道的所有控制了。”他被介绍到一家很好的康复中心，但是他拒绝接受帮助。康复中心准备把他送回家，为那些愿意为他自己的生活负责的人让路。这是一个转折点。查尔斯知道，如果他被送回家，他就没有任何机会了。这是他对自己的宇宙说是或不是的时候了。他很感激自己选择了说“是”。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Once that choice was made, his progress was remarkable. Opportunities opened up to him that he’d never thought about before. He decided that his life could have a purpose: to help others in their struggle, whatever that struggle might be. He would be a model, saying, “If I could do it, so can you.” Charles admitted to me that, strangely, he was grateful now for his handicap, because it made him aware of how much he had to contribute to the world.<br class="calibre4"/>一旦做出了这个选择，他的进步是显著的。机会向他敞开，这是他以前从未想过的。他决定他的人生可以有一个目标: 帮助别人在他们的斗争中，无论那是什么样的斗争。他会成为一个模范，说: “如果我能做到，你也可以。”查尔斯向我承认，奇怪的是，他现在对自己的残疾心存感激，因为这使他意识到他必须为这个世界做出多少贡献。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Before the accident, Charles had been blind to the fact that his life had meaning. Now he believes he was more handicapped before the accident; only since then has he derived satisfaction from living.<br class="calibre4"/>在事故发生之前，查尔斯对他的生命有意义这一事实视而不见。现在他相信他在事故发生前更加残疾; 只有从那时起他才从生活中得到满足。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">When I presented the concept of SAY YES TO YOUR UNIVERSE in class, one of my students asked an interesting question: “If you always say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to your universe, wouldn’t you be able to avoid feeling any pain?” I thought about it for a moment and told him no. You can’t avoid pain, but you can say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to the pain, understanding that it is a part of life. You do not, then, feel yourself a victim. You know that you can handle the pain, as well as the situation causing the pain. You do not feel it is hopeless. At that point, my student shouted, “I get it! You mean there is the pain of <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> versus the pain of <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no.</em>” That was exactly what I meant.<br class="calibre4"/>当我在课堂上提出“对你的宇宙说是”这个概念时，我的一个学生问了一个有趣的问题: “如果你总是对你的宇宙说是，难道你就不能避免任何痛苦吗?”我想了一会儿，然后拒绝了他。你无法避免痛苦，但是你可以对痛苦说是，理解它是生活的一部分。那么，你就不会觉得自己是一个受害者。你知道你可以处理痛苦，以及造成痛苦的情况。你不会感到绝望。就在这时，我的学生喊道: “我明白了！你的意思是，是的痛苦和不是的痛苦。”我就是这个意思。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As the class looked at it further, they were able to find examples of when they had said <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to pain in their lives without realizing what they were doing. Nadine remembered one day the previous week when she had thought about her mother, who had recently died. Suddenly she was struck by the pain of loss. She sat down and cried, thinking how strangely sweet it felt to remember good times she had shared with her mother. And as she cried, she felt the urge to say “thanks” over and over again.<br class="calibre4"/>随着课堂的进一步研究，他们能够找到这样的例子: 当他们在没有意识到自己在做什么的情况下对生活中的痛苦说“是”的时候。纳丁记得前一周的一天，她想起了她刚刚去世的母亲。突然，她被失去亲人的痛苦所打动。她坐了下来，哭了起来，想着回忆起和母亲一起度过的美好时光是多么的甜蜜。当她哭泣的时候，她感到一次又一次地说“谢谢”的冲动。</p>
<p class="calibre9">She was aware, in the middle of her pain, that life hands you a lot of good-byes—but that’s just the way life is. Yet she saw the difference between handling the death of a loved one as a catastrophe (saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no</em>) and keeping in mind how blessed she was to have had that person in her life (saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em>). It is seeing death as part of living—a natural process—as opposed to seeing it as a horrible deprivation and unjust phenomenon.<br class="calibre4"/>她意识到，在她的痛苦之中，生活会给你许多告别——但生活就是这样。然而，她看到了处理一个亲人的死亡是一个灾难(说不)和记住她是多么幸运有这样一个人在她的生活(说是)之间的区别。她把死亡看作是生活的一部分——一个自然的过程——而不是把它看作一种可怕的剥夺和不公正的现象。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Betsy, another student, remembered the sweetness of the pain she felt as she kissed her son good-bye when he went off to college. With tears in her eyes, she watched him walk down the path to his new car, knowing he would return again only as a visitor. It was now time to let him go. She reported thinking, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes,</em> this is the way life is . . . always changing. Things don’t last forever. She let herself cry for a while, but soon picked herself up and decided to prepare a candlelit dinner. After all, she and her husband would be alone for the first time in many years, so she was determined to make a honeymoon of it.<br class="calibre4"/>另一名学生 Betsy 回忆起儿子上大学时，她与他吻别时那种甜蜜的痛苦。她眼中含着泪水，看着他沿着小路走向他的新车，她知道他只会以一个访客的身份再次回来。是时候让他走了。她说她在想，是的，生活就是这样，总是在变化。事情不会永远持续。她让自己哭了一会儿，但很快就振作起来，决定准备一顿烛光晚餐。毕竟这是她和丈夫多年来第一次单独相处，所以她决定度蜜月。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Compare this with a parent who dreads her children leaving home, and when it finally happens is able to see only the emptiness of the house and the uselessness of her life. Such a person, resisting change, misses the new pathways opening up for her. Betsy’s story beautifully demonstrates the ability to feel pain when something ends but then to go on and build new hopes and dreams for oneself. There is something enriching about leaving one beautiful experience in your life and looking forward to other beautiful experiences.<br class="calibre4"/>相比之下，一位父母害怕孩子离家出走，当这一切最终发生时，她只能看到房子的空虚和生活的无用。这样的人，拒绝改变，错过了为她打开的新路径。Betsy 的故事漂亮地展示了当一些事情结束时感受痛苦的能力，然后继续为自己建立新的希望和梦想。在你的生命中留下一段美好的经历，并期待着其他美好的经历，这是一件非常丰富的事情。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Marge shared with the class the pain she felt when her husband died. Yes, she missed her husband and the warmth and companionship he had given her, but she was also aware of how she had transformed herself from a dependent to an independent person when left to her own resources. Her sense of self-esteem had increased enormously as she slowly learned to take risks she had never taken before. She was able to say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to life and create a whole new world for herself.<br class="calibre4"/>马姬和全班同学分享了她丈夫去世时的痛苦。是的，她想念她的丈夫，想念他给予她的温暖和陪伴，但是她也意识到当她被留给自己的资源时，她是如何从一个依赖他人的人变成一个独立的人的。随着她慢慢学会承担以前从未承担过的风险，她的自尊心大大增强了。她能够接受生活，为自己创造一个全新的世界。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Marge could have reacted like a friend of mine did. He refused to pick up the pieces and go on after his wife died. Five years later, he is still crying on the phone, asking, “Why did she have to die?” He has said <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no</em> to his universe. Unfortunately, he doesn’t see that the universe isn’t suffering, only he is, and perhaps the few people who still talk to him on the phone. He has refused to see the blessings in his life—and there are many—or the opportunities around him to meet new people and try new experiences. The pain of <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no</em> leaves him feeling powerless.<br class="calibre4"/>马姬本可以像我的一个朋友那样做出反应。妻子死后，他拒绝收拾残局，继续生活。五年后，他仍然在电话里哭泣，问道: “为什么她必须死?”他对自己的世界说不。不幸的是，他没有看到宇宙并没有受苦，只有他在受苦，也许还有少数几个还在和他通电话的人。他拒绝看到他生命中的幸福——他身边有很多幸福——或者他有机会认识新的人，尝试新的体验。失败的痛苦让他感到无能为力。</p>
<p class="calibre9">In the final analysis, it can be said that your ability to cope effectively with the world around you corresponds to your ability to say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to your universe, including the pain. Remember:<br class="calibre4"/>归根结底，可以说，你有效应对周围世界的能力，与你对自己的宇宙说“是”的能力相对应，包括痛苦。记住:</p>

<p class="spaceabove1">Sandy is someone who avoided her pain. When her son died in an automobile accident twelve years ago, she never faced the full impact of the loss. Friends remarked on how well she had handled her son’s death. Three years later, she developed epilepsy, which seemed to be unrelated to the loss she had experienced. For nine years she suffered from seizures that prevented her from working. In addition, her relationships with her husband and other children were slowly deteriorating.<br class="calibre4"/>桑迪是一个逃避痛苦的人。当她的儿子12年前死于一场车祸时，她从来没有面对过失去儿子的全部影响。朋友们都说她对儿子的死处理得很好。三年后，她患上了癫痫症，这似乎与她所经历的丧亲之痛无关。九年来，她一直遭受癫痫的折磨，无法工作。此外，她与丈夫和其他孩子的关系也在慢慢恶化。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Sandy finally went to a support group to get help in dealing with the upset the epilepsy was creating within the family. During the first session, the group leader asked if she had ever suffered a great loss. She said yes, but explained that it had happened so long ago that it was no longer a factor in her life. He knew better and with great skill managed to get her back into the experience of her son’s death. It was then that she finally allowed her grief to emerge.<br class="calibre4"/>桑迪最终去了一个互助小组，寻求帮助，以应对癫痫在家庭内部造成的不安。在第一次治疗中，组长问她是否曾经遭受过巨大的损失。她说是的，但解释说那是很久以前的事了，已经不再是她生活中的一个因素了。他知道的更多，并且用高超的技巧设法让她重新回到她儿子死亡的经历中。就在那时，她终于开始释放悲伤。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Each time the group met, Sandy continued to deal with her pain. Almost “miraculously,” her epileptic symptoms disappeared within five weeks. She discontinued her medication, found a good job, and began to repair the damage done within her home as a result of her illness. Pain can be incredibly destructive if kept submerged. Although Sandy’s is a dramatic example, unacknowledged pain is subtly destroying many people’s lives.<br class="calibre4"/>每次大家见面，桑迪都会继续处理她的痛苦。几乎是“奇迹般地”，她的癫痫症状在五周内就消失了。她停止了药物治疗，找到了一份好工作，并开始修复因病在家中造成的损害。痛苦如果被淹没，会带来难以置信的破坏性。虽然桑迪是一个戏剧性的例子，未被承认的痛苦正在微妙地摧毁许多人的生活。</p>
<p class="calibre9">We all know people who are out of touch with their pain—who have refused to let themselves feel their emotions. When we don’t acknowledge our pain, it will be transferred into a bodily symptom, anger, or something equally destructive. Saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> means letting in the pain full force, knowing that you will not only get to the other side of it, but also gain something in the end—if you look for it.<br class="calibre4"/>我们都知道有些人与他们的痛苦失去了联系，他们拒绝让自己感受他们的情感。当我们不承认自己的痛苦时，它就会转化为身体上的症状，愤怒，或者同样具有破坏性的东西。说“是”意味着让痛苦全力以赴，知道你不仅会走到痛苦的另一边，而且最终还会得到一些东西——如果你去寻找的话。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">As the class discussions continued, my students and I came up with an interesting thought: the richer our lives, the more likely we are to experience the pain of loss. If we have a multitude of friends, we will have to deal with more goodbyes. The more we are able to reach out into the world, the greater the likelihood is that we are going to experience “failure” or rejection. But those who are living rich lives wouldn’t change them for a moment. They delight in the opportunity to taste all that life has to offer—the good and the bad. The class also decided that it is likely that those who lead rich lives intuitively know the secret of saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to the universe. Those who say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no</em> usually withdraw from life, choosing symbolically to hide under the covers to keep themselves from becoming victims—ironically, ending up complete victims of their own fears.<br class="calibre4"/>随着课堂讨论的继续，我和我的学生提出了一个有趣的想法: 我们的生活越丰富，我们就越有可能经历失去的痛苦。如果我们有很多朋友，我们将不得不面对更多的告别。我们能够接触到的世界越多，我们就越有可能经历“失败”或被拒绝。但是那些过着富裕生活的人一刻也不会改变他们。他们很高兴有机会品尝生活所提供的一切——好的和坏的。这个班级还认为，那些过着富裕生活的人很可能凭直觉就知道对宇宙说“是”的秘密。那些说“不”的人通常会退出生活，象征性地选择隐藏起来，以免自己成为受害者——具有讽刺意味的是，他们最终会成为自己恐惧的完全受害者。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I found the most extreme and moving example of saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> in the pages of Viktor Frankl’s book <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Man’s Search for Meaning.</em> It was given to me by a friend, who said “I think it’s really important for you to read this book.”<br class="calibre4"/>我在维克多 · 弗兰克尔的《人类寻找意义》一书中发现了一个最极端、最感人的例子: 说“是”。这是一个朋友给我的，他说: “我认为读这本书对你来说真的很重要。”</p>
<p class="calibre9">I was upset to learn that the book was about Frankl’s experience in a concentration camp—a subject I had carefully avoided. It was simply too frightening for me to look at. I had viewed life in a concentration camp as the most terrible experience a human being could endure—mentally, physically, and spiritually. I really didn’t want to read this book, and was about to put it aside when my friend’s words came back to me: “I think it’s really important for you to read this book.” She obviously knew something I didn’t, so I decided to find out what she was talking about.<br class="calibre4"/>当我得知这本书是关于弗兰克在集中营的经历时，我感到很沮丧——我一直小心翼翼地回避这个话题。这对我来说实在是太可怕了。在我看来，集中营的生活是人类所能忍受的最可怕的经历——无论是精神上、身体上还是精神上。我真的不想读这本书，正要把它放在一边，这时朋友的话又回来了: “我认为读这本书对你来说真的很重要。”她显然知道一些我不知道的事情，所以我决定弄清楚她在说什么。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I painfully pushed through page after page of descriptions that defied human comprehension. I couldn’t keep back my tears. But as I continued to read, my heart slowly started to lighten. Not only had Frankl and others like him faced life in a concentration camp, but, according to the definition given earlier, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">they had actually said yes to their universe</em>! They were able to create a positive experience out of what life had handed them. They were able to find personal meaning and growth— and a way of seeing the world that created value from their experience. As Frankl wrote:<br class="calibre4"/>我痛苦地翻阅着一页又一页难以理解的描述。我忍不住流下了眼泪。但是当我继续阅读的时候，我的心慢慢地开始放松。弗兰克和其他像他一样的人不仅面临着集中营的生活，而且，根据之前给出的定义，他们实际上已经对他们的宇宙说好了！他们能够从生活给予他们的东西中创造出一种积极的体验。他们能够找到个人的意义和成长——以及一种从他们的经历中创造价值的看待世界的方式。正如弗兰克尔写道:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre6">
<p class="noindent">The experiences of camp life show that a man does have a choice of action. There were enough examples, often of a heroic nature, which proved that apathy could be overcome, irritability suppressed. Man <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">can</em> preserve a vestige of spiritual freedom, of independence of mind, even in such terrible conditions of psychic and physical stress. We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. They may have been few in number, but they offer sufficient proof that everything can be taken away from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s way. The way in which a man accepts his fate and all the suffering it entails, the way in which he takes up his cross, gives him ample opportunity—even in the most difficult circumstances—to add a deeper meaning to his life.<br class="calibre4"/>集中营生活的经历表明，一个人确实可以选择行动。有足够的例子，往往是英雄的本性，证明冷漠是可以克服的，易怒是可以抑制的。人类可以保留一丝精神自由的痕迹，心灵独立的痕迹，即使在如此可怕的心理和生理压力的条件下。我们这些生活在集中营里的人还记得那些走过棚屋安慰他人，送出他们最后一片面包的人。他们可能人数不多，但他们提供了充分的证据，证明一个人的一切都可以被剥夺，除了一样东西: 人类最后的自由——在任何特定的环境中选择自己的态度，选择自己的道路。一个人接受命运和它所带来的一切痛苦的方式，他背起十字架的方式，给了他充分的机会——即使在最困难的情况下——给他的生活增加更深层次的意义。</p>

<p class="noindent">As I finished the last page, I knew that a dramatic change had taken place within me. I would never again experience fear with the same intensity I had experienced it before reading the book. I knew that if Frankl was able to create something positive out of his experience, which was the worst my mind could imagine, then I—and everyone else—could create value out of anything life could possibly hand me. It is a matter of remaining conscious that we have the choice.<br class="calibre4"/>当我读完最后一页时，我知道我内心发生了戏剧性的变化。我再也不会像读这本书之前那样强烈地感受到恐惧。我知道，如果弗兰克能够从他的经历中创造出一些积极的东西——这是我能想到的最糟糕的情况——那么我——以及其他所有人——就能从生活可能给我的任何东西中创造出价值。我们有选择的余地，这是一个保持清醒的问题。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I am sure that, given the option, Frankl would have preferred not to go through the experience, but the concentration camp was what life handed him. It was then up to him to create his reaction to the situation. We can’t control the world, but we can control our reactions to it. I think you now begin to see how SAY YES TO YOUR UNIVERSE can work, not only to reduce fear, but also to create meaning in life.<br class="calibre4"/>我敢肯定，如果有选择的话，弗兰克宁愿不要经历这种经历，但是集中营是生活给他的。接下来就看他如何应对这种情况了。我们无法控制这个世界，但我们可以控制我们对它的反应。我想你现在开始明白，对你的宇宙说“是”不仅可以减少恐惧，而且可以创造生命的意义。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">During another class, one of my students argued that if we say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to everything, we are accepting everything. If we accept everything, then we won’t act to change things that are wrong with this world. I explained to him that saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> means positive action; saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no</em> means giving up. It is only when we see <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">possibility</em> for change that we can work to effect change. We can say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no</em> to the situation as it is, but <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to the possibility for the growth it offers. If you believe that a situation in your life is hopeless, you simply sit back and let yourself be destroyed.<br class="calibre4"/>在另一节课上，我的一个学生争辩说，如果我们对所有事情都说“是”，那么我们就是在接受所有事情。如果我们接受一切，那么我们就不会采取行动去改变这个世界的错误。我向他解释说，说“是”意味着积极的行动; 说“不”意味着放弃。只有当我们看到改变的可能性时，我们才能努力去实现改变。我们可以对现状说“不”，但是对它所带来的成长的可能性说“是”。如果你相信你生活中的某种情况是绝望的，你只需要坐下来让自己被摧毁。</p>
<p class="calibre9">On a global level, if you believe that it is hopeless to halt nuclear annihilation, you won’t get involved in standing up for peaceful solutions to the world’s problems. If you know this situation is <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">not</em> hopeless, you say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to the opportunity to get involved in the process of making ours a peaceful planet, as so many people are doing throughout the world. These people are not paralyzed by fear, because they are saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to the opportunities inherent in the situation.<br class="calibre4"/>在全球层面上，如果你认为制止核毁灭是不可能的，你就不会参与支持和平解决世界问题的行动。如果你知道这种情况并非毫无希望，你就会对参与使我们的星球成为一个和平星球的进程的机会说是，就像世界各地许多人正在做的那样。这些人并没有因为恐惧而瘫痪，因为他们对这种状况所固有的机会说“是”。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> does not mean giving up.<br class="calibre4"/>答应并不意味着放弃。</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="smallcaps">SAYING YES MEANS GETTING UP AND ACTING ON YOUR </span>

<p class="spaceabove1">It means channeling resources to find constructive, healthy ways to deal with adverse situations. It means acting out of strength, not weakness. It means having the flexibility necessary to survey many options and choose ones that enhance growth. It does not mean being destroyed; it means becoming alive to possibility.<br class="calibre4"/>它意味着调动资源，找到建设性的、健康的方法来处理不利的情况。它意味着发挥自己的优势，而不是软弱。它意味着拥有必要的灵活性，以调查许多选择，并选择那些促进增长的选择。这并不意味着被摧毁，而是意味着对可能性充满活力。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Whereas the <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">concept</em> of saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to your universe is fairly easy to grasp, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">learning</em> to say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> requires a great deal of awareness. We seem to have an automatic reflex that pushes the <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no</em> button. It is not so easy to understand how to say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> when a child is gravely ill, when you become physically disabled, when you lose your job, or when your spouse dies. Remember:<br class="calibre4"/>虽然对你的宇宙说“是”这个概念相当容易理解，但学会说“是”却需要大量的意识。我们似乎有一种按下“不”按钮的自动反射。当孩子病得很严重，当你身体残疾，当你失去工作，或者当你的配偶去世时，要理解如何说“是”并不容易。记住:</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent1">We are all winners when we say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes,</em> and it is worth every effort to learn how. The following steps will help:<br class="calibre4"/>当我们说“是”的时候，我们都是成功者，我们值得付出一切努力去学习如何成功。下面的步骤将会有所帮助:</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">1. Create <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">awareness</em> that you are saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no.</em> It helps to surround yourself with reminders. Put signs on your desk, on your night table, on your mirrors, in your daily calendar, or wherever you’ll see them. Some signs that helped me were: <strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">SAY YES TO YOUR UNIVERSE (an obvious one); I AM FINDING VALUE IN EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO ME; LET GO.</strong> My daughter gave me a wonderful poster that said, IF LIFE GIVES YOU LEMONS, MAKE LEMONADE. You can create your own sayings that work best for you. The object is to <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">stay conscious.</em> We are asleep on this issue and need to be constantly reminded.<br class="calibre4"/>1.让别人知道你在说“不”。让自己置身于提醒的环境中会有所帮助。在你的桌子上，床头柜上，镜子上，日历上，或者任何你能看到的地方放一些标志。一些帮助我的迹象是: 对你的宇宙说“是”(一个显而易见的迹象) ; 我正在发现发生在我身上的每件事的价值; 放手吧。我女儿给了我一张很棒的海报，上面写着: “如果生活给了你柠檬，那就做柠檬汁吧。”。你可以创造出最适合自己的格言。目标是保持清醒。我们在这个问题上睡着了，需要不断地被提醒。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">2. Once consciousness is there, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">actually nod your head up and down, say yes.</em> There is something about physically affirming an idea that helps to create acceptance. Try nodding your head right now. You’ll notice that you feel something positive about the feeling of physically nodding in agreement. It gives you the sense that everything will be all right—because you are going to make it all right.<br class="calibre4"/>2.一旦有了意识，实际上要上下点头，说“是”。在身体上肯定一个想法有助于创造接受。试着现在就点头。你会发现你对身体上点头表示同意的感觉是积极的。它给你一种一切都会好起来的感觉——因为你会让一切都好起来。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">3. Using the same principle, physically relax your body, starting from the top of your head and going to the tip of your toes. Notice where you are tense and focus on letting the tension go. Again the body can take the lead in setting up positive feelings. This is discussed later.<br class="calibre4"/>3.使用同样的原则，身体放松你的身体，从你的头顶开始到你的脚趾尖。注意你紧张的地方，集中精力放松。再一次，身体可以带头建立积极的情绪。这一点稍后再讨论。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">4. Look for ways to create value from any experience. Ask yourself these questions: What can I learn from the experience? How can I use this experience to positive advantage? How can I learn to better myself as a result of this experience? Simply having the intent to create something positive automatically ensures that something positive will happen. As discussed in Chapter 7, let go of the picture of what the outcome “should” be in order to open the way for possibilities your mind is incapable of envisioning.<br class="calibre4"/>4.从任何经历中寻找创造价值的方法。问问自己这些问题: 我能从经验中学到什么？我如何利用这次经历获得积极的好处？我怎样才能从这次经历中学到更好的自己？只要有创造积极事物的意图，就能自动确保积极事物的发生。正如在第七章中所讨论的那样，为了打开你的头脑无法想象的可能性的道路，放下结果“应该”是什么的图景。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">5. Be patient with yourself. DON’TSAY<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">NO</em>TO YOUR DIFFICULTY IN SAYING<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">YES.</em> This is one of those concepts that seems easy but requires diligence to put into practice. It is easy to feel frustrated when gloom and doom overtake you. Just keep noticing this. Trust that you’ll eventually get bored being depressed or upset and that you’ll then find a way out of the quicksand. Most of us do anyway. Saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> helps you find your way much faster, thus vastly improving the quality of your life.<br class="calibre4"/>5.对自己要有耐心。DO n’tsayno to YOUR DIFFICULTY IN SAYINGYES 不要拒绝说“是”的困难。这是一个看起来很简单，但需要努力付诸实践的概念。当黑暗和厄运笼罩你的时候，你很容易感到沮丧。只要保持注意这一点。相信你最终会厌倦沮丧或沮丧，然后你会找到一条出路。无论如何，我们大多数人都会这样做。说“是”可以帮助你更快地找到自己的路，从而极大地提高你的生活质量。</p>
<p class="calibre9">One additional tip may be helpful. Start practicing on trivial events in your life. Although they may have nothing to do with fear, they will give you practice with the process. For example, as you sit in your car fuming because of a traffic jam, a sign on the dashboard that reads SAY YES TO YOUR UNIVERSE may remind you that you are saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no.</em> Once you can create this awareness, you can nod your head, relax your body, and begin to use the experience to some advantage. You can use such time to listen to some of the great “inspirational” audios that are available or an audio book you have no time to read. Or you can be grateful that for the moment nothing very taxing is demanded of you. So sit back and enjoy the experience.<br class="calibre4"/>一个额外的建议可能是有帮助的。从生活中琐碎的事情开始练习。尽管它们可能与恐惧无关，但它们会让你在这个过程中不断练习。例如，当你因为交通堵塞而坐在车里怒气冲冲时，仪表盘上写着“向你的宇宙说好”的标志可能会提醒你说“不”。一旦你产生了这种意识，你就可以点头，放松你的身体，并开始利用这种经历获得一些好处。你可以利用这些时间来听一些很棒的“鼓舞人心”的音频，或者听一本你没有时间读的有声书。或者，你可以感激现在没有什么非常繁重的事情需要你去做。所以，坐下来享受这段经历吧。</p>
<p class="calibre9">If you are worried that you are keeping someone waiting, remember that there is nothing you can do about it, so you might as well relax. It is a perfect opportunity to learn that in the future you will need to allow more time for unexpected delays.<br class="calibre4"/>如果你担心有人在等你，记住你对此无能为力，所以你最好放松一下。这是一个绝佳的机会，让你知道在未来你需要为意想不到的延误留出更多的时间。</p>
<p class="calibre9">If you are on the other end, waiting, muttering to yourself, “He’s late again!” focus on saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to the fact that you now have an opportunity to people-watch or reflect on the day’s activities. I’m one of those people who loves to wait. It gives me a rare opportunity to do nothing without feeling guilty!<br class="calibre4"/>如果你在另一端，等待着，喃喃自语，“他又迟到了!”专注于对你现在有机会与人交流的事实说“是”——观察或反思一天的活动。我是那种喜欢等待的人。这给了我一个难得的机会，让我无所事事而不感到内疚！</p>
<p class="calibre9">Life offers many opportunities to practice saying <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">yes</em> to your universe. The baby spills milk all over the floor; your secretary loses the letter you dictated; the cleaner ruins your suit—get the picture? Every time you find yourself resisting what’s happening at the present moment, recall the phrase SAY YES TO YOUR UNIVERSE. You will watch your life become more and more pleasurable. Relationships with the whole world will improve dramatically.<br class="calibre4"/>生活提供了许多机会来练习对你的宇宙说“是”。婴儿把牛奶洒得满地都是; 你的秘书弄丢了你口述的信; 清洁工弄坏了你的西装——明白了吗？每当你发现自己在抵制此时此刻正在发生的事情时，回想一下这句话: 对你的宇宙说“是”。你会看到你的生活变得越来越快乐。与整个世界的关系会得到戏剧性的改善。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Once you master the concept on a day-to-day level, you will be prepared to handle the more serious issues that confront you. You will notice that your level of fear slowly starts to drop as it is replaced by a greater sense of trust in your ability to handle your world. As you start to see the possibilities in the impossible, you will begin to see that the world works “perfectly.” You can find reason and purpose in everything—if you open your mind to it.<br class="calibre4"/>一旦你在日常生活中掌握了这个概念，你就会准备好处理你面临的更严重的问题。你会注意到你的恐惧水平慢慢开始下降，取而代之的是对你处理自己世界的能力更大的信任感。当你开始看到不可能的可能性时，你将开始看到这个世界运转得“完美”你可以在任何事情中找到理由和目标——如果你敞开心扉。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The only time you will fear anything is when you say <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">no</em> and resist the universe. You may have heard the expression “Go with the flow.” This means consciously accepting what is happening in your life. I once heard it said that the key to life is not to figure out what you can <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">get from</em> the flow, but, rather, to figure out how to <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">get into</em> the flow. Or, as Barry Stevens titled her book, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Don’t Push the River</em> (it flows by itself ). Stop fighting your life. Let go and let the river carry you to new adventures by the way you experience your life. In this way—and only in this way—it is impossible to lose.<br class="calibre4"/>你唯一会害怕任何事情的时候就是你拒绝和抵抗宇宙的时候。你可能听说过“顺其自然”这句话这意味着有意识地接受生活中正在发生的事情。我曾经听人说过，生活的关键不在于弄清楚你能从心流中得到什么，而在于弄清楚如何进入心流。或者，正如巴里 · 史蒂文斯(Barry Stevens)给她的书命名的那样，不要推动河流(它自己流动)。停止与你的生活作斗争。放手，让河流通过你体验生活的方式带你去新的冒险。以这种方式——也只有这种方式——你不可能失去它。</p>
