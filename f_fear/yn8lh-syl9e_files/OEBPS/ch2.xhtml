<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="drop">J</span>anet’s still waiting for the fear to go away. She had always planned to return to college once her children were in school, but she now notices it’s been four years since her youngest child entered first grade. New excuses have popped up since that time: “I want to be here when the children come home from school”; “We really don’t have the money”; “My husband will feel neglected.”<br class="calibre4"/>珍妮特还在等待恐惧消失。她一直计划在孩子们上学后重返大学，但现在她注意到，她最小的孩子上一年级已经四年了。从那时起，新的借口就出现了: “我想在孩子们放学回家的时候呆在这里”; “我们真的没有钱”; “我丈夫会觉得被忽视了”</p>
<p class="calibre9">Although it is true that certain logistics would have to be worked out, that is not the reason for her hesitation. In fact, her husband is willing to help her in any way he can. He is concerned about her restlessness, and often encourages her to fulfill her lifelong dream of becoming a fashion designer.<br class="calibre4"/>虽然确实需要安排一些后勤工作，但这并不是她犹豫的原因。事实上，她的丈夫愿意尽他所能帮助她。他关心她的不安，经常鼓励她去实现她一生的梦想，成为一名时装设计师。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Each time Janet thinks about calling the local college to set up an interview, something stops her. “When I’m not so frightened, then I’ll make the call”; “When I feel a little better about myself, then I’ll make the call.” Most likely Janet is going to wait a very long time.<br class="calibre4"/>每次珍妮特想打电话给当地大学安排面试时，总有什么东西阻止了她。“当我不那么害怕的时候，我就会打电话”; “当我对自己感觉好一点的时候，我就会打电话。”珍妮特很可能会等很长时间。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The problem is that her thinking is all mixed up. The logic she uses automatically programs her for failure. She will never break the fear barrier until she is made aware of her faulty thinking; she simply does not “see” what is obvious to those who are out there doing it.<br class="calibre4"/>问题是她的想法很混乱。她使用的逻辑自动为她的失败编程。除非她意识到自己的错误思维，否则她永远不会突破恐惧的屏障; 她只是没有“看到”那些正在做这件事的人所明显看到的东西。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Nor did I until I was forced to. Before my divorce from my first husband, I was rather like a child, allowing him to take over the practicalities of my life. After my divorce, I had no choice but to start doing things on my own. Small things, such as fixing the vacuum cleaner all by myself, brought me enormous satisfaction. The first night I invited people to my home for dinner as a single person was a monumental leap. The day I booked tickets for my first trip without a man was a day for celebration.<br class="calibre4"/>我也不知道，直到我被迫。在我和第一任丈夫离婚之前，我就像一个孩子，允许他接管我的生活。离婚后，我别无选择，只能开始自己做事。一些小事，比如自己修理吸尘器，给我带来了巨大的满足感。我第一次单独邀请别人到我家吃晚饭是一个巨大的飞跃。我订了第一次没有男人的旅行的票的那天是庆祝的日子。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As I began to <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">do</em> things on my own, I began to taste the deliciousness of an emerging self-confidence. It wasn’t all comfortable—in fact, a lot of it was extremely uncomfortable. I felt like a child learning to walk and falling frequently. But with each step I felt a little surer of my ability to handle my life.<br class="calibre4"/>当我开始自己做事情的时候，我开始尝到一种自信的滋味。这种感觉并不总是舒服的——事实上，很多都是极其不舒服的。我感觉自己就像一个学习走路和经常摔倒的孩子。但是每走一步，我都对自己掌控生活的能力感到更加自信。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As my confidence grew, I kept waiting for the fear to go away. Yet each time I ventured out into a new territory, I felt frightened and unsure of myself. “Well,” I told myself, “just keep putting yourself out there. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Eventually</em> the fear will go away.” It never did! One day a lightbulb went on in my head as I suddenly realized the following “truth”:<br class="calibre4"/>随着我信心的增长，我一直在等待恐惧消失。然而，每次我冒险进入一个新的领域，我都感到害怕和不确定自己。我告诉自己: “那么，就继续把自己放在那里吧。最终恐惧会消失。”从来没有！一天，当我突然意识到以下的“事实”时，我的脑海里闪过一个想法:</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">TRUTH 1 </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
真相1
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">THE FEAR WILL NEVER GO AWAY </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
恐惧永远不会消失
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">AS LONG AS I CONTINUE TO GROW.</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
只要我继续成长。
</p>
<p class="noindent1">As long as I continued to push out into the world, as long as I continued to stretch my capabilities, as long as I continued to take new risks in making my dreams come true, I was going to experience fear. What a revelation! Like Janet, and so many of you reading this book, I had grown up waiting for the fear to go away before I took any chances. “When I am no longer afraid . . . then!” For most of my life, I had played the WHEN/THEN game. And it never worked.<br class="calibre4"/>只要我继续向外推进，只要我继续拓展我的能力，只要我继续冒新的风险，让我的梦想成真，我就会经历恐惧。这是多么大的启示啊！就像珍妮特，还有很多读过这本书的人一样，我从小就在等待恐惧消失，然后再去冒险。“当我不再害怕的时候... ... 那么!”在我人生的大部分时间里，我都在玩“当/然”的游戏。但是从来没有成功过。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Once again you are probably not jumping up and down with joy. I am aware that this revelation is not exactly one you wanted to hear. If you are like my students, you were hoping that my words of wisdom would miraculously make your fears go away. I’m sorry to say that it doesn’t work that way. On the other hand, rather than think of it as a disappointment, consider it a relief that you no longer have to work so hard on getting rid of the fear. It isn’t going to go away! Not to worry. As you build your confidence in yourself with the exercises suggested herein, your relationship with fear will dramatically alter.<br class="calibre4"/>再一次地，你可能不会因为喜悦而跳上跳下。我知道这个启示并不是你想听到的。如果你像我的学生一样，你希望我的智慧之言能奇迹般地消除你的恐惧。我很遗憾地说，事实并非如此。另一方面，与其把它看作是一种失望，不如把它看作是一种解脱，因为你不必再为摆脱恐惧而如此努力地工作。恐惧不会消失！别担心。当你通过本文建议的练习来建立自信时，你与恐惧的关系将会发生戏剧性的改变。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">Not long after discovering Truth 1, I made another important discovery that contributed enormously to my growth:<br class="calibre4"/>发现真理1后不久，我又有了另一个重要的发现，这个发现对我的成长起到了巨大的作用:</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">TRUTH 2 </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
真理2
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">THE ONLY WAY TO GET RID OF THE FEAR </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
摆脱恐惧的唯一方法
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">OF DOING SOMETHING IS TO GO OUT AND DO IT.</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
做某件事的恐惧，就是走出去去做。
</p>
<p class="noindent1">This sounds contradictory to Truth 1, yet it isn’t. Fear of <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">particular</em> situations dissolved when I finally confronted them. The “doing it” comes <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">before</em> the fear goes away.<br class="calibre4"/>这听起来与真理1相矛盾，但事实并非如此。当我最终面对特定情况时，对它们的恐惧就消失了。在恐惧消失之前，“做这件事”就来了。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I can illustrate this by recounting my first teaching experience when I was studying for my doctorate. I was not much older than my students, and I was teaching a subject in which I had dubious expertise—the psychology of aging. I anticipated the first class period with a tremendous sense of dread. During the three days prior to the class, my stomach felt like it was on a roller coaster. I had prepared eight hours of work for a one-hour class. I had handwritten enough material for three lectures. None of this took away my fear. When the first day of class finally arrived, I felt like I was being sent to the guillotine. As I stood in front of my students, I could feel my heart pounding and my knees shaking. Somehow I got through that class period—not ecstatically looking forward to the second one the following week.<br class="calibre4"/>我可以通过讲述我在攻读博士学位时的第一次教学经历来说明这一点。我当时比我的学生大不了多少，而且我教的这门学科我的专业知识还不够专业——衰老心理学。我怀着巨大的恐惧感期待着第一节课的到来。在上课前的三天里，我的胃就像坐过山车一样。我为一个小时的课程准备了八个小时的作业。我手写了足够三堂课的材料。这些都没有消除我的恐惧。当上课的第一天终于到来的时候，我感觉自己像是被送上了断头台。当我站在学生面前的时候，我能感觉到我的心在怦怦直跳，我的膝盖在颤抖。不知怎么的，我熬过了那节课——并没有兴高采烈地期待下周的第二节课。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Thankfully, things were easier the next time. (If not, I might have left teaching permanently!) I started to become familiar with the faces in the classroom and connected some of the names to the faces. The third class was better than the second, as I started to relax and go with the flow of the students. By our sixth session I was actually looking forward to standing in front of my class. The interaction with my students was stimulating and challenging. One day, as I was approaching that once-dreaded classroom, I realized I was no longer afraid. My fear had turned into sweet anticipation.<br class="calibre4"/>谢天谢地，下一次事情就简单多了。(如果不是，我可能会永远离开教学我开始熟悉教室里的面孔，并把一些名字和面孔联系起来。第三节课比第二节课好，我开始放松下来，跟着学生的节奏走。到了第六节课的时候，我真的很期待站在全班同学面前。与学生的互动既刺激又富有挑战性。有一天，当我走近那间曾经令人畏惧的教室时，我意识到我不再害怕了。我的恐惧变成了甜蜜的期待。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I had to teach a number of different courses before I was comfortable walking into class without voluminous notes. But there did come a day when all I had in hand was a one-page outline of what I intended to cover that period. I realized how far I had come. I had felt the fear . . . and did it anyway. As a result, I got rid of my fear of teaching. Yet, when I took my teaching into the television arena, once again I experienced fear, until my “doing it” often enough eliminated my fear of appearing on television. So it goes.<br class="calibre4"/>我不得不教授许多不同的课程，才能在没有大量笔记的情况下自如地走进教室。但有一天，我手头上只有一页纸的大纲，上面写着我打算讲述的那段时间的内容。我意识到我已经走了多远。我感受到了恐惧，但我还是做到了。结果，我摆脱了对教书的恐惧。然而，当我把我的教学带入电视舞台，我再一次经历了恐惧，直到我的“做它”足够消除我出现在电视上的恐惧。事情就是这样。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">Another part of the WHEN/THEN game I used to play had to do with self-esteem. “When I feel better about myself . . . then I’ll do it.” This is another mix-up in the order of reality. I kept thinking that if I could improve my self-image, then the fear would go away and I could start accomplishing things. I didn’t know exactly <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">how</em> my self-image was going to improve. Perhaps by my growing older and wiser, or through feedback from other people, or a miracle would make me feel wonderful about myself. I actually bought myself a belt buckle that read I’M TERRIFIC, thinking that through osmosis I’d get the message.<br class="calibre4"/>我过去常玩的 WHEN/THEN 游戏的另一个部分与自尊有关。“当我对自己感觉好一点的时候... ... 我就会去做。”这是另一个现实秩序的混乱。我一直在想，如果我能改善我的自我形象，那么恐惧就会消失，我就能开始完成一些事情。我不知道我的自我形象会如何改善。也许是因为我变得越来越老，越来越聪明，或者是通过别人的反馈，或者是一个奇迹会让我对自己感觉很棒。事实上，我给自己买了一个皮带扣，上面写着“我棒极了”，想着通过渗透，我会得到这个信息。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Maybe all those things did help a little. What really made the difference, however, was the sense of accomplishment I felt in pushing through fear and doing things on my own. Finally, this became clear:<br class="calibre4"/>也许所有这些确实有一点帮助。然而，真正起作用的是我在克服恐惧和自己做事情时的成就感。最后，这一点变得清晰了:</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent1">The “doing it” comes <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">before</em> the feeling better about yourself. When you make something happen, not only does the fear of the situation go away, but also you get a big bonus: you do a lot toward building your self-confidence. It’s fairly predictable, however, that when you’ve finally mastered something and gotten rid of the fear, it will feel so good that you will decide that there is something else out there you want to accomplish, and—guess what! The fear begins again as you prepare to meet a new challenge.<br class="calibre4"/>在自我感觉良好之前，“去做”是最重要的。当你让事情发生时，不仅对情况的恐惧消失了，而且你还得到了一大笔奖金: 你为建立自信做了很多。然而，当你最终掌握了一些东西，摆脱了恐惧，这种感觉是如此美妙，以至于你会决定还有其他的事情需要你去完成——猜猜是什么！当你准备迎接新的挑战时，恐惧又开始了。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">Through all the workshops and seminars I attended in my early stages of dealing with fear, I was relieved to learn something else that made me feel infinitely better about myself:<br class="calibre4"/>在与恐惧作斗争的早期阶段，我参加了各种各样的研讨会和讲习班，学到了一些让我对自己感觉无限好的东西，这让我松了一口气:</p>

</p>
<p class="noindent1">I said to myself: <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">“You mean all those people out there that I’ve been envying because they’re not afraid to move ahead with their lives have really been afraid? Why didn’t somebody tell me!?”</em> I guess I never asked. I was sure I was the only person out there feeling so inadequate. It was such a relief to realize I was not alone in this. I had the rest of the world to keep me company.<br class="calibre4"/>我对自己说: “你的意思是那些我一直羡慕的人，因为他们不害怕继续他们的生活，他们真的害怕了吗？为什么没有人告诉我!”我想我从来没问过。我确信我是唯一一个觉得自己不够格的人。意识到自己并不是唯一一个这样做的人，我真是松了一口气。我有世界上其他人的陪伴。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I remember a newspaper article I read years ago about Ed Koch, the seemingly fearless mayor of New York City. The article told how he had to learn a tap-dance routine with the cast of a Broadway show for a publicity event. His teacher reported that the mayor was scared to death. This was hard to believe! A man who had often faced crowds of angry people, who had made many difficult decisions affecting millions of lives, who had put himself before the public in his race to be mayor . . . and he was afraid to learn a simple tap dance!<br class="calibre4"/>我记得几年前读过一篇关于 Ed Koch 的报纸文章，他是纽约市看似无畏的市长。那篇文章讲述了他如何不得不和百老汇演出的演员们一起学习踢踏舞，为一个宣传活动做准备。他的老师报告说，市长被吓死了。难以置信！他经常面对愤怒的人群，做出了许多困难的决定，影响了数百万人的生活，在竞选市长的过程中，他把自己放在公众面前，却不敢学一个简单的踢踏舞！</p>
<p class="calibre9">If one is aware of the Fear Truths, the mayor’s fear will not come as a surprise. Tap dancing was an activity that tested him in a new way, and of course he would be frightened. Once he practiced and mastered the routine, the fear would go away, and his confidence in himself would be heightened—he could put another feather in his cap, so to speak. That’s simply the way it works<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">—for all of us.</em> By virtue of our all being human, we share the same feelings. Fear is no exception.<br class="calibre4"/>如果一个人意识到了恐惧的真相，市长的恐惧就不会让人感到意外。踢踏舞是一项以新的方式考验他的活动，当然他会感到害怕。一旦他练习并掌握了这套动作，恐惧就会消失，他对自己的信心就会增强——可以说，他可以在帽子上再插一根羽毛。对我们所有人来说，这就是简单的运作方式。因为我们都是人类，所以我们有着相同的感受。恐惧也不例外。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Many stories similar to Mayor Koch’s appear in newspapers, magazines, and books and on television. Until you are in touch with the Fear Truths, you will hear about and read and see these stories and not notice the underlying principles operating. You may never relate the experiences of others, especially those of celebrities, to your life. You may think they are lucky because they aren’t afraid to put themselves out there. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Not so!</em> They had to push through a tremendous amount of fear to get where they are today . . . and they are still pushing.<br class="calibre4"/>许多类似于科赫市长的故事出现在报纸、杂志、书籍和电视上。除非你接触到恐惧的真相，否则你将会听到、阅读和看到这些故事，而不会注意到其背后的运作原理。你可能永远不会把别人的经历，尤其是名人的经历和你的生活联系起来。你可能认为他们是幸运的，因为他们不害怕把自己放在那里。事实并非如此！他们不得不克服巨大的恐惧，才走到今天这一步... ... 而且他们仍在努力。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Those who have successfully dealt with fear all their lives seem to have known, consciously or unconsciously, the message in this book: You must feel the fear . . . and do it anyway. A very successful friend of mine, a self-made man who allowed nothing to stop him along the way, pondered the title of my course one day, nodded, and said, “Yes, I guess that is the way I’ve always lived my life, without consciously realizing that’s what I’ve been doing. I can’t remember not being afraid, but it never occurred to me that fear would prevent me from taking the risks necessary to get what I wanted. I just went ahead and did what I had to do to make my ideas work— despite the fear.”<br class="calibre4"/>那些一生都成功地应对恐惧的人似乎已经有意识或无意识地知道了这本书中的信息: 你必须感受到恐惧... ... 无论如何都要去做。我的一个非常成功的朋友，一个白手起家的人，一路上没有什么可以阻止他。有一天，他思考了一下我课程的标题，点了点头，说: “是的，我想这就是我一直以来的生活方式，没有意识到我一直在做的事情。我不记得我不害怕，但是我从来没有想过害怕会阻止我去冒必要的风险去得到我想要的。我只是继续前进，做我必须做的事情，使我的想法工作-尽管恐惧。”</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">If you have not been successful in dealing with fear, you probably never learned the Fear Truths, and interpreted fear as a signal to retreat rather than as a green light to move ahead. You have tended to play those WHEN/THEN games I mentioned earlier. All you have to do to find a way out of your self-imposed prison is to retrain your thinking.<br class="calibre4"/>如果你没有成功地处理恐惧，你可能从来没有学会恐惧的真相，并将恐惧解释为撤退的信号，而不是前进的绿灯。你倾向于玩我之前提到的那些 WHEN/THEN 游戏。你所要做的就是重新训练你的思维，从而找到一条走出自我囚禁的道路。</p>
<p class="calibre9">A first step in retraining your thinking is to say the Fear Truths at least ten times a day for the next month. As you will shortly discover, retraining faulty thinking takes constant repetition. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Knowing</em> the Fear Truths is not enough. You have to keep feeding them to yourself until they become a part of your being—until you start to reverse your behavior and move <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">toward</em> your desired goals, rather than retreating. There will be more later about why repetition is important. For now, just trust me and repeat the Fear Truths over and over again.<br class="calibre4"/>重新训练你的思维的第一步是在接下来的一个月里，每天至少说十次“恐惧真相”。你很快就会发现，重新训练错误的思维需要不断的重复。知道恐惧的真相是不够的。你必须不断地把它们喂给自己，直到它们成为你存在的一部分——直到你开始扭转你的行为，朝着你想要的目标前进，而不是退缩。以后会有更多关于为什么重复很重要的内容。现在，请相信我，一遍又一遍地重复“恐惧真相”。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Before you begin, however, I’d like to add one very important Fear Truth to the list. You might already have been asking yourself, “Why should I put myself through all the discomfort that comes with taking risks? Why don’t I just go on living my life the way I’ve been living it?” You might find my answer to that question surprising. It is:<br class="calibre4"/>然而，在你开始之前，我想在列表中添加一个非常重要的恐惧真相。你可能已经问过自己，“为什么我要让自己经历冒险带来的所有不适？为什么我不继续过我现在的生活呢?”你可能会对我对这个问题的回答感到惊讶。答案是:</p>

来自无助的感觉。
</p>
<p class="noindent1">Read it again. I know it’s hard to take in at first. It says that no matter how “secure” any of us feel in the little cocoon we have built for ourselves, we live, consciously or unconsciously, with the fear that the day of reckoning will eventually come.<br class="calibre4"/>再读一遍。我知道一开始很难接受。它说，无论我们中的任何一个人在为自己建立的小茧中感到多么“安全”，我们都有意识或无意识地生活在对最终审判日到来的恐惧之中。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The more helpless we feel, the more severe is the undercurrent of dread that comes with knowing there are situations in life over which we have no control—such as the death of a spouse or the loss of a job. We find ourselves becoming obsessive about possible catastrophes. “What if . . . ? ”Fear permeates our lives. That is the irony of Fear Truth 5: people who refuse to take risks live with a feeling of dread that is far more severe than what they would feel if they took the risks necessary to make them less helpless—only they don’t know it!<br class="calibre4"/>我们越感到无助，就越感到恐惧的潜流，这种潜流伴随着我们知道生活中有些情况是我们无法控制的——比如配偶的死亡或者失业。我们发现自己对可能发生的灾难越来越着迷。“如果... ... ?”恐惧充斥着我们的生活。这就是恐惧真相5的讽刺之处: 拒绝冒险的人生活在一种恐惧之中，这种恐惧远比他们为了减少无助而冒必要的风险时所感受到的要严重得多——只是他们自己不知道罢了！</p>
<p class="calibre9">I can illustrate with the case of Janice, a middle-aged housewife, who “planned” her life in such a way as to avoid risk taking as much as possible. She married a successful businessman who handled both their lives. Janice allowed this situation because it was more comfortable for her never to put herself on the line. But, as the saying goes, “Life is what happens when we’ve made other plans!” At the age of fifty-three, her husband, Dick, had a stroke, which left him partially disabled. One day she was totally <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">taken</em> care of and the next she was totally <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">taking</em> care of.<br class="calibre4"/>我可以用 Janice 的例子来说明，她是一位中年家庭主妇，她“规划”自己的生活，以避免尽可能多的冒险。她嫁给了一个成功的商人，这个商人掌管着她们的生活。珍妮丝之所以允许这种情况发生，是因为对她来说，永远不把自己置于危险之中会更舒服一些。但是，正如俗话所说，“生活就是我们制定其他计划时发生的事情!”在她53岁的时候，她的丈夫迪克中风了，导致他部分残疾。前一天她被完全照顾，第二天她被完全照顾。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The transition wasn’t easy. After fighting the rage of “Why did this happen to me?” she started to accept the fact that she was now in charge of both her own and her husband’s survival. Numbed, she went through the motions of learning his business, handling decisions regarding his health, and waking up every morning with the understanding that it was now up to her. After a while, the numbness left, the fog cleared, and she discovered a profound sense of peace she had never experienced before. She started to realize the heavy price she had paid to be taken care of.<br class="calibre4"/>转变并不容易。在与“为什么这会发生在我身上?”的愤怒抗争之后她开始接受这样一个事实，她现在要对自己和丈夫的生存负责。她麻木不仁，一步一步地学习他的业务，处理有关他健康的决定，每天早上醒来都明白现在该由她自己做决定了。过了一会儿，麻木的感觉消失了，迷雾散去，她感受到了一种前所未有的宁静。她开始意识到自己为了得到照顾付出了多么沉重的代价。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Prior to her husband’s stroke, Janice’s thinking had been permeated with the phrase “what if?” She always worried about the future, never enjoying her todays. She had lived with the underlying dread, “My God, what if something happened to him?” She had often remarked to her friends, “I hope I die before he does. I couldn’t live without him.” And she thought she couldn’t—which is a less-than-satisfactory way to go through life. This all changed as she found strength she never thought she had. She now knows the answer to her question “what if?” The answer is: “I’ll handle it!”<br class="calibre4"/>在她丈夫中风之前，Janice 的脑子里充满了“如果”这个短语她总是担心未来，从来没有享受过现在。她一直生活在潜在的恐惧中，“我的上帝，如果他发生了什么事怎么办?”她经常对她的朋友们说，“我希望我能在他之前死去。没有他我活不下去。”她认为自己不能——这是一种不太令人满意的生活方式。这一切都改变了，因为她找到了她从未想过自己拥有的力量。她现在知道了“如果”这个问题的答案答案是: “我会处理的!”</p>
<p class="calibre9">Janice had never realized she was living with terror all her life until that terror disappeared. The new fears were nothing compared to her old fears about survival. Her husband has now recovered enough for them to live a satisfying life together. He, too, has faced one of his biggest fears—that of becoming disabled. He got the answer to his question “what if?” which was also “I’ll handle it.” They both handled it beautifully. In fact, through this experience they learned the real meaning of love.<br class="calibre4"/>直到恐惧消失，珍妮丝才意识到她一生都生活在恐惧之中。这些新的恐惧和她以前对生存的恐惧相比根本不值一提。她的丈夫现在已经恢复到足以让他们一起过上满意的生活。他也面临着他最大的恐惧之一——成为残疾人。他得到了“如果”这个问题的答案也就是”我会处理的”他们都处理得很好。事实上，通过这次经历，他们学到了爱的真正含义。</p>
<p class="calibre9">By now you’ve gotten the picture. We can’t escape fear. We can only transform it into a companion that accompanies us in all our exciting adventures; it is not an anchor holding us transfixed in one spot. Some people have told me they are never afraid, but when I question them, they reveal that we are just differing on semantics. Yes, they feel nervous or anxious some-times—they simply never labeled it fear.<br class="calibre4"/>现在你已经明白了。我们无法逃避恐惧。我们只能把恐惧转变成一个伴侣，陪伴我们经历所有激动人心的冒险; 它不是把我们固定在一个地方的锚。有些人告诉我他们从不害怕，但是当我问他们的时候，他们发现我们只是在语义上有所不同。是的，他们有时会感到紧张或焦虑——他们只是从来不把它称为恐惧。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As far as I know, everyone feels fear as he or she moves forward through life. It is absolutely possible that there are some evolved souls in this world who never experience fear, but I have not met them. If I do, I promise I will become their avid student and report back to you with their secrets. You see, I “know” on some deep level there is nothing to fear. It’s the surface level that needs convincing. In the meantime I’ve learned to “feel the fear . . . and do it anyway!” As I do, whether I feel the fear or not becomes irrelevant. My life will work in either case . . . as will yours.<br class="calibre4"/>据我所知，每个人在生活中前进的时候都会感到恐惧。这个世界上绝对可能存在一些从未经历过恐惧的进化灵魂，但我从未见过他们。如果我见到他们，我保证我会成为他们的狂热学生，并向你们报告他们的秘密。你看，在某种程度上，我“知道”没有什么可怕的。需要说服的是表面层面。与此同时，我学会了“感受恐惧... ... 无论如何都要去做!”当我这样做的时候，我是否感受到恐惧就变得无关紧要了。不管怎样，我的生活都会好起来的，你的也是。</p>
