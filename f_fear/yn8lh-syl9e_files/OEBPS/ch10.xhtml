<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="drop">D</span>o you consider yourself a giving person? Think about it for a moment.<br class="calibre4"/>你认为自己是一个乐于奉献的人吗? 想一想。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I asked this question of some of my students one morning, most of whom were married, and they all nodded their heads, meaning yes. Therefore, they were bewildered by their own reactions to the homework assignment I then gave them, which was simply, “Go home and say ‘thank you’ to your spouses.” There was a distinct sense of discomfort in the room. You would have thought I had asked them to go home and beat their children! Finally, Lottie, who had been married for twenty-five years, piped up with, “Why should I say thank you to my husband? He should be glad I’m there!”<br class="calibre4"/>有一天早上，我问了我的一些学生这个问题，他们中的大多数都结婚了，他们都点头表示愿意。因此，他们被自己对我布置给他们的家庭作业的反应搞糊涂了，我布置的家庭作业很简单，就是“回家对你的配偶说声‘谢谢’。”房间里有一种明显的不舒服感。你会以为我让他们回家去打他们的孩子！最后，结婚25年的洛蒂尖声说道: “我为什么要对我丈夫说谢谢？他应该高兴我在那里!”</p>
<p class="calibre9">“Lottie, why <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">are</em> you there?” I asked. Her response was rather evasive—something to the effect that “he’d be a mess without me, and, besides, it would be too much trouble to leave.” I repeated my question. After much prodding from me and the rest of the class, Lottie was finally able to acknowledge that her husband gave her a number of advantages: companionship, financial security, and the feeling that she was not alone. I said, “Fine, so go home and thank him for that.”<br class="calibre4"/>“ Lottie，你为什么在那里?”我问。她的回答相当含糊其辞——大意是“没有我，他会一团糟，而且，离开也太麻烦了。”我重复了我的问题。在我和班上其他同学的多次督促下，Lottie 终于承认她的丈夫给了她很多好处: 陪伴、经济保障，以及她并不孤单的感觉。我说: “好吧，回家去感谢他吧。”</p>
<p class="calibre9">The following session brought the students into class with looks of dismay on their faces. They couldn’t believe how difficult it had been to acknowledge the contribution of their spouses. Some were able to do the assignment, though with reluctance; others simply could not do it at all. Some reported that they also tried to thank their children and parents, and that that, too, was very difficult. For the first time, they were forced to question just how giving they really were.<br class="calibre4"/>接下来的一段时间，学生们带着沮丧的表情走进了教室。他们无法相信，要承认配偶的贡献有多么困难。一些人能够完成这项任务，尽管他们不情愿; 另一些人根本不能完成。一些人说他们也试图感谢他们的孩子和父母，这也是非常困难的。这是他们第一次被迫质疑自己到底给予了多少。</p>
<p class="calibre9">This did not mean that they were not contributing in other areas of their relationships. For the most part, they handled the details of the home, raised the children, and performed the obligatory tasks of the marriage. But were they really giving? Did they really know how to give? Or did they just exchange a “you do this for me” with an “I’ll do this for you”?<br class="calibre4"/>这并不意味着他们没有在他们关系的其他方面做出贡献。在大多数情况下，他们处理家庭的细节，抚养孩子，履行婚姻的义务。但是他们真的付出了吗？他们真的知道如何给予吗？或者他们只是把“你为我做这件事”和“我会为你做这件事”交换了？</p>
<p class="calibre9">Needless to say, my students were quite dismayed by what they had discovered about themselves in this simple assignment. I assured them that most of us in our society do not really know how to give. Most of us operate on a hidden barter system. Few genuinely ever give anything away without expecting something in return—money, appreciation, love, or whatever.<br class="calibre4"/>不用说，我的学生们对他们在这个简单的作业中发现的自己感到非常沮丧。我向他们保证，我们社会中的大多数人并不真正知道如何给予。我们大多数人都在一个隐藏的物物交换系统中运作。很少有人会真正地放弃任何东西而不期待任何回报——金钱、感激、爱或任何东西。</p>
<p class="calibre9">You might be saying, “What’s wrong with getting back?” My answer is, “Nothing.” However:<br class="calibre4"/>你可能会说，“回去有什么不好?”我的回答是，“没什么。”然而:</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">IF ALL YOUR “GIVING” IS ABOUT “GETTING,” </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
如果你所有的“付出”都是为了“得到”,
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">THINK HOW FEARFUL YOU WILL BECOME.</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
想想你会变得多么恐惧。
</p>
<p class="noindent1">More than likely the question will soon become, “Am I getting back <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">enough</em>?” This kind of thinking sets up an incredible need to control others so you won’t feel shortchanged, destroys your peace of mind, and creates anger and resentment.<br class="calibre4"/>很有可能问题很快就会变成: “我回来的够多吗?”这种想法建立了一种难以置信的控制他人的需求，这样你就不会感到被欺骗，破坏你内心的平静，并产生愤怒和怨恨。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Now you can see what’s wrong with “getting” being the most important motivation for “giving.” In fact:<br class="calibre4"/>现在你可以看到把“获得”作为“给予”最重要的动机有什么不对了。事实上:</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">GENUINE GIVING IS NOT ONLY ALTRUISTIC;</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
真正的给予不仅仅是利他的;
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">IT ALSO MAKES US FEEL BETTER.</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
这也让我们感觉好多了。
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">Why do we find it so difficult to give? My theory has two components. First, it requires a mature adult to give, and most of us have never really grown up. Second, giving is an acquired skill that few of us have mastered. These components are tied together and require a great deal of practice to achieve. The reason most of us have never practiced these skills is simple— it usually never occurs to us that we aren’t behaving like adults or that we aren’t giving. We have unwittingly deceived ourselves. And this is understandable. We <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">look</em> like we are adults and we <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">seem</em> to be giving people. What’s going on underneath, however, belies appearances.<br class="calibre4"/>为什么我们发现给予如此困难？我的理论有两个部分。首先，它需要一个成熟的成年人去给予，而我们大多数人从未真正长大。其次，给予是一种后天获得的技能，我们中很少有人掌握。这些要素是紧密联系在一起的，需要大量的练习才能达到。我们大多数人从来没有练习过这些技能的原因很简单——我们通常从来没有想过我们的行为不像成年人或者我们没有给予。我们无意中欺骗了自己。这是可以理解的。我们看起来像是成年人，我们似乎在给予别人。然而，在我们内心深处发生的事情掩盖了我们的外表。</p>
<p class="calibre9">One of the most important lessons one has to learn in life is how to give, and <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">therein lies an answer to fear.</em> As babies we represent the ultimate in neediness. We come into this world as total takers. We have to take, or we will die. Our survival is tied up with the world nurturing us. We give little back. We don’t care what time we wake our parents when we are hungry, or how loudly we scream and bother the neighbors when we want to be picked up.<br class="calibre4"/>一个人在生活中必须学会的最重要的课程之一就是如何给予，这就是对恐惧的回答。作为婴儿，我们代表了最终的需求。我们来到这个世界上，是作为一个完全的索取者。我们必须索取，否则我们会死。我们的生存与世界的养育息息相关。我们很少回报。当我们饿的时候，我们不在乎什么时候叫醒我们的父母，或者当我们想被人抱起来的时候，我们大声尖叫，打扰邻居。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Yes, parents often get a feeling of joy from the smile or the touch of their child and, in that sense, the child is a giver—but I doubt if the child spent the night pondering: “My life is abundant. I have so much to give away that I think I’ll reward my parents with a great big smile tomorrow morning.” No, their “gift” is on a rather primitive or reflexive level. In fact, a hungry belly in the morning will produce only loud shrieks of impatience.<br class="calibre4"/>是的，父母经常从孩子的微笑或触摸中获得快乐的感觉，从这个意义上说，孩子是一个给予者——但我怀疑孩子是否整晚都在思考: “我的生活是丰富的。我有很多东西可以给予，所以我想明天早上我会给我的父母一个灿烂的微笑。”不，他们的“礼物”是在一个相当原始或反射的水平。事实上，早上一个饥饿的肚子只会产生不耐烦的尖叫。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As the years pass, we function as more and more independent beings, able to take care of ourselves—or so it appears. We dress ourselves, we feed ourselves, we earn a living. Yet there seems to be a part of us that never progresses much beyond the crib. Metaphorically, we remain frightened that no one will come to relieve our hunger—for food, money, love, praise, and so on. Any relief in the way of “food” is only temporary; we know the hunger will come again.<br class="calibre4"/>随着岁月的流逝，我们的功能越来越独立，能够照顾好自己——或者看起来是这样。我们自己穿衣服，自己吃饭，自己谋生。然而，似乎有一部分的我们从来没有在婴儿床之外取得太大的进步。打个比方，我们仍然害怕没有人来解除我们的饥饿——食物、金钱、爱情、赞美等等。任何以“食物”的方式获得的解脱都只是暂时的，我们知道饥饿还会再次出现。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Imagine what this dilemma sets up for us in the area of our daily living. We can’t give. We can’t love. We become, consciously or unconsciously, manipulative, because our survival is involved. We can’t support the well-being of another person if their needs in any way conflict with ours. And how do we feel operating from the level of the playpen? Helpless, trapped, angry, frustrated, dissatisfied, unfulfilled, and, most of all, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">fearful.</em><br class="calibre4"/>想象一下，在我们的日常生活中，这种困境会给我们带来什么。我们不能给予。我们不能去爱。我们有意识或无意识地变得善于操纵别人，因为这涉及到我们的生存。如果他人的需求与我们的有任何冲突，我们就不能支持他人的幸福。那么，我们站在游戏围栏的角度来操作是什么感觉呢？无助，被困，愤怒，沮丧，不满，不满足，最重要的是，恐惧。</p>
<p class="calibre9">What can be more frightening than depending on someone else for one’s survival? As fearful adults, we ask the same questions we did as a child. Will they go away and not come back? Will they stop loving me? Will they take care of me? Will they get sick and die? As adults, we ask these questions about our mates, and often about our friends, boss, parents, and even children.<br class="calibre4"/>还有什么比依靠别人生存更可怕的呢？作为恐惧的成年人，我们会问和小时候一样的问题。他们会离开而不再回来吗？他们会停止爱我吗？他们会照顾我吗？他们会生病死去吗？作为成年人，我们经常会问自己的伴侣、朋友、老板、父母甚至孩子这些问题。</p>
<p class="calibre9">People who fear can’t genuinely give. They are imbued with a deep-seated sense of scarcity in the world, as if there wasn’t enough to go around. Not enough love, not enough money, not enough praise, not enough attention—simply not enough. Usually fear in one area of our lives generalizes, and we become closed down and protective in many areas of our lives. Fearful people can be visualized as crouched and hugging themselves. Whereas this image represents the inner state of all frightened people, the outer manifestation can take on many forms:<br class="calibre4"/>害怕的人不能真正给予。他们被一种根深蒂固的世界匮乏感所包围，就好像世界上没有足够的东西可以分配一样。没有足够的爱，没有足够的金钱，没有足够的赞美，没有足够的关注——简直就是不够。通常我们生活中的某个领域的恐惧是普遍存在的，我们在生活中的许多领域变得封闭和保护。恐惧的人可以想象成蜷缩着拥抱自己。尽管这个图像代表了所有恐惧的人的内心状态，但是外在的表现形式可以有很多种:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre6">
<p class="noindent">Successful businessmen needing the boss’s approval<br class="calibre4"/>成功的商人需要老板的认可</p>
<p class="noindent">Housewives who blame their husbands or children for the fact that they never lived their own lives<br class="calibre4"/>家庭主妇指责她们的丈夫或孩子从来没有过自己的生活</p>
<p class="noindent">Independent career women who demand so much from their men that they are often alone<br class="calibre4"/>独立的职业女性对她们的男人要求太多，以至于她们经常独自一人</p>
<p class="noindent">Men who can’t tolerate their wives’ independence<br class="calibre4"/>无法忍受妻子独立的男人</p>
<p class="noindent">Company executives who make harmful, irresponsible decisions<br class="calibre4"/>做出有害、不负责任决定的公司高管</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="noindent">They are all in some way operating out of a sense of fear for their own survival. They all are, in effect, crouched and withholding inside.<br class="calibre4"/>他们在某种程度上都是出于对自己生存的恐惧。他们实际上都蜷缩在内心深处。</p>
<p class="calibre9">If you recognize yourself in this description, join the rest of us. There are few in our society who have actually been taught the secrets of growing up and giving. We have been taught the illusion of giving, but not the actuality of giving. As we have been taught to be careful in terms of our physical safety, we have also been taught not to let anyone con us or take advantage of us. As a result, unless we get something back, we feel used.<br class="calibre4"/>如果你认识这个人，请加入我们。在我们的社会中，很少有人真正学会了成长和付出的秘诀。我们被灌输给予的错觉，而不是给予的现实。正如我们被教导要小心我们的人身安全一样，我们也被教导不要让任何人欺骗或利用我们。因此，除非我们拿回一些东西，否则我们会觉得被利用了。</p>
<p class="calibre9">This is not to say that we can’t enjoy what comes back to us, and paradoxically:<br class="calibre4"/>这并不是说我们不能享受回到我们身边的东西，矛盾的是:</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">WHEN WE GIVE FROM A PLACE OF LOVE, </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
当我们从爱的地方给予,
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">RATHER THAN FROM A PLACE OF EXPECTATION, </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
而不是出于期待,
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">MORE USUALLY COMES BACK TO US </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
通常会有更多的人回来找我们
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">THAN WE COULD HAVE EVER IMAGINED.</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
远远超出我们的想象。
</p>
<p class="noindent1">But if we are constantly expecting, we will spend a great deal of our lives disappointed that the world isn’t treating us right.<br class="calibre4"/>但是，如果我们不断地期待，我们将花费大量的我们的生活失望，因为这个世界没有正确对待我们。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I didn’t find my way out of this painful state of existence until my mid-thirties, when it finally dawned on me that no matter how much I had in my life, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">nothing would ever be enough</em>! The more I had, the more I wanted—more love, more money, more praise—more, more, more. Obviously, something I was or wasn’t doing was keeping me from ever feeling satisfied. And, worse, it was keeping me in a state of constant fear that everything I had would ultimately disappear and there would be nothing left. I saw everything as the proverbial last drink of water in the desert, and I hung on for dear life.<br class="calibre4"/>我一直没有找到摆脱这种痛苦生活状态的方法，直到我三十多岁的时候，我才终于明白，无论我的生活中有多少东西，都是不够的！我拥有的越多，我想要的就越多——更多的爱，更多的钱，更多的赞美——越来越多，越来越多。很明显，我正在做或者没有做的事情让我从来没有感到满足。更糟糕的是，它让我一直处于一种恐惧的状态，害怕我所拥有的一切最终都会消失，一无所有。我把一切都看作是众所周知的沙漠中的最后一口水，我为了宝贵的生命坚持着。</p>
<p class="calibre9">It was time to try another way of being, since my old way was definitely not serving me, or anyone else in my life. As I described earlier, I sought out many teachers and got many answers. In essence, I learned that in order to get rid of the fear of lack, I had to do the <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">opposite</em> of what I had been doing up until that time. Instead of hanging on to everything for dear life, I had to start releasing, letting go, giving it away. If you think anything else in this book is difficult, wait until you try this one! It’s really a Catch-22: It’s easy to give when you feel abundantly endowed, but you only feel that way <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">when</em> you give, not before! So: FEEL THE FEAR . . . AND DO IT ANYWAY!<br class="calibre4"/>是时候尝试另一种生活方式了，因为我以前的生活方式绝对不适合我，也不适合我生活中的任何人。正如我之前所描述的，我找了很多老师，得到了很多答案。从本质上讲，我明白了为了摆脱对匮乏的恐惧，我必须做与之前相反的事情。我不再为了宝贵的生命而抓住一切不放，我必须开始释放，放手，放弃一切。如果你觉得这本书里的其他东西都很难，那就等着看看这本吧！这真是一个进退两难的问题: 当你觉得自己被赋予了很多东西的时候，给予是很容易的，但是你只有在给予的时候才会有这种感觉，而不是在给予之前！所以: 感受恐惧。无论如何都要去做！</p>
<p class="calibre9">Again let me remind you that what I am presenting is a lifelong process that you can begin working on today. There is no magical potion as yet. It is amazing how long it takes to become a full-blown adult. In fact, one might consider it a lifelong task. I’ve been working on this for years and I’m still working on it. The good news, however, is that my sense of personal power and my ability to love and trust has increased at least 1,000% since I have been practicing giving it away. Many fears in the areas discussed below have completely disappeared for me. The rewards are monumental. I promise!<br class="calibre4"/>让我再次提醒你，我所展示的是一个终身的过程，你可以从今天开始着手。目前还没有什么神奇的药剂。令人惊讶的是，成为一个成年人需要这么长的时间。事实上，人们可能会认为这是一个终身的任务。我已经为此努力了很多年，现在还在努力。不过，好消息是，自从我练习把自己的力量给予别人以来，我的个人力量感和我爱与信任的能力至少增加了1000% 。以下讨论的许多恐惧对我来说已经完全消失了。回报是巨大的。我保证！</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">Give Away Thanks</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
谢谢
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">Start by thinking about the people presently in your life and significant ones in your past. Put their names on a sheet of paper. Then list what each of them contributed to you in their own special way. Even if they brought you pain and you dislike them intensely, list their contribution to your life. As with Lottie, earlier, despite what she felt about her husband, there was much that he had provided her. Also, it’s possible to make a gift even out of a negative.<br class="calibre4"/>首先想想你现在生活中的人和你过去重要的人。把他们的名字写在一张纸上。然后列出他们每个人以自己独特的方式为你做出的贡献。即使他们给你带来痛苦，而你非常不喜欢他们，列出他们对你生活的贡献。和 Lottie 一样，早些时候，不管她对丈夫有什么感觉，他给了她很多东西。而且，即使是消极的东西也可以做成礼物。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I apologized to my son one day for the fact that at the time I got divorced I wasn’t there for him emotionally when he might have needed me. I was too wrapped up in my own pain to help him with his. His answer was, “It’s okay, Mom. That was the period of my life when I learned independence. That was a valuable lesson.” He was able to thank me for my lack! In terms of mental health, he was far better off than if he had carried around resentment all those years. So, even if you perceive that someone has mistreated you, find the lesson you learned from them and put the contribution on your list.<br class="calibre4"/>有一天，我向儿子道歉，因为在我离婚的时候，当他可能需要我的时候，我没有在情感上支持他。我太沉浸在自己的痛苦中，无法帮助他。他的回答是”没事的，妈妈。那是我学会独立的人生阶段。那是宝贵的一课。”他能够感谢我的不足！在心理健康方面，他比那些年心怀怨恨要好得多。所以，即使你意识到有人虐待过你，也要从他们身上吸取教训，把这些贡献写在你的清单上。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Once you have listed all the gifts from various people in your life, systematically go about thanking them. If it is someone you haven’t seen or heard from in a while, surprise them with a call or a letter simply acknowledging them for what they have contributed to your life. You will be amazed at the pleasure you will get—and give—from doing this.<br class="calibre4"/>一旦你列出了生活中不同人给你的所有礼物，系统地去感谢他们。如果是一个你很久没有见到或听到的人，给他打个电话或写封信，简单地感谢他为你的生活做出的贡献，给他一个惊喜。你会惊奇地发现你从这样做中得到的快乐和付出。</p>
<p class="calibre9">With some people in your life, such as an ex-spouse, ex-friends or bosses, alienated parents or children, this can be especially difficult. To help rid yourself of present feelings of resentment and anger, try an exercise I learned in a workshop many moons ago:<br class="calibre4"/>对于你生活中的某些人，比如前配偶，前朋友或老板，疏远的父母或孩子，这可能是特别困难的。为了帮助自己摆脱现在的怨恨和愤怒，试试我很久以前在一个研讨会上学到的一个练习:</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">Find an empty room and turn off the telephone. Put on some soothing music. Sit down in a comfortable chair and close your eyes. Visualize someone who brings up a lot of anger or pain in you. Picture them in front of you. First, surround them with rays of healing white light and tell them that you wish them all good things—everything they could possibly want in their lifetime. Thank them for whatever they have given you. Keep doing this until you feel your negative emotions leaving.<br class="calibre4"/>找一个空房间，关掉电话。放一些舒缓的音乐。坐在舒适的椅子上，闭上眼睛。想象一下某个人给你带来了很多愤怒或痛苦。想象他们就在你面前。首先，用治愈的白光包围他们，告诉他们你希望他们拥有一切美好的东西——他们一生中可能想要的一切。感谢他们给予你的一切。一直这样做，直到你感觉到你的负面情绪正在消失。</p>
<p class="calibre9">To say this is not easy is to utter the biggest understatement in the world. “Wish <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">her</em> good things? Are you out of your mind? I want to see her suffer for what she’s done to me!”<br class="calibre4"/>说这并不容易，简直是世界上最轻描淡写的说法。祝她好运？你疯了吗？我要看着她为她对我做的事受苦</p>
<p class="calibre9">The first time I did this exercise, I picked someone who had previously worked for me, and who had caused me a great deal of upset and pain. I had trusted him, and, to my mind, he had betrayed me. Note the victim mentality in full bloom! Obviously I was not taking responsibility for my experience of life at that time. As I went through the exercise, I experienced an incredible series of emotions.<br class="calibre4"/>我第一次做这个练习的时候，我选择了一个以前为我工作过的人，他给我带来了很多烦恼和痛苦。我曾经信任他，在我看来，他背叛了我。注意受害者心态的盛开！很明显，当时我并没有为自己的生活经历负责。当我经历这次锻炼时，我经历了一系列令人难以置信的情绪。</p>
<p class="calibre9">First, I was shocked at the anger and resentment I was holding. I found it almost impossible, even in my mind’s eye, to wish him anything good. My initial anger toward him was monumental. As I slowly released the anger, I got in touch with the pain I felt. This turned to anger at myself for allowing what had happened and for holding all my anger for so long. This turned into forgiveness of myself and of him. I was able to see both of us simply as people who had done the best we could at the time. I could then surround us both with healing white light.<br class="calibre4"/>首先，我对自己的愤怒和怨恨感到震惊。我发现几乎不可能，甚至在我的脑海里，祝他好运。我最初对他的愤怒是巨大的。当我慢慢地释放愤怒的时候，我感受到了痛苦。这转变成了对我自己的愤怒，因为我允许发生了这些事情，并且长时间地压抑着我的愤怒。这变成了对我自己和他的原谅。我能够把我们两个简单地看作是那个时候我们已经尽了最大努力的人。然后我可以用治愈的白光包围我们。</p>
<p class="calibre9">This process took about an hour. When I began, I thought nothing much would happen. Wrong! I screamed, I cried, I hurt, I hated, I opened up, I forgave, I loved, I felt peace. I continued to do this exercise daily until I no longer felt anything negative about him and could freely wish him all good things.<br class="calibre4"/>这个过程大约花了一个小时。当我开始的时候，我以为不会发生什么事情。错！我尖叫，我哭泣，我伤害，我恨，我敞开心扉，我原谅，我爱，我感到平静。我继续每天做这个练习，直到我不再对他有任何负面的感觉，可以自由地祝愿他一切都好。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I did this exercise for all the people in my life for whom I was holding any negativity, no matter how great or how slight. One of the people was my ex-husband. When I was able to reach the point in my visualization when I wished him only good, I phoned him and invited him to lunch. I simply said that there were some things I’d never told him and I wanted to do so now. He was pleased I called and we met for lunch.<br class="calibre4"/>我做这个练习是为了我生命中所有对我持有消极态度的人，不管他们多么伟大或者多么渺小。其中一个人就是我的前夫。当我想象到我只希望他好的时候，我打电话给他，邀请他共进午餐。我只是说有些事情我从来没有告诉过他，现在我想告诉他。他很高兴我给他打了电话，我们一起吃了午饭。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I told him all the things that I really did appreciate about him when we were married and the qualities in him that I admire. My openness invited openness on his part, and he shared things about me that were loving as well. When I left lunch that day, I felt I had completed something that heretofore had been incomplete—and it felt wonderful.<br class="calibre4"/>我告诉他我们结婚的时候，我真的很欣赏他的一切，以及我欣赏他身上的品质。我的开放让他变得开放，他也和我分享了他对我的爱。那天午餐结束后，我觉得自己完成了一件以前没有完成的事情——感觉棒极了。</p>
<p class="calibre9">If you cannot actually meet with people on your list, do it in your mind. Talk to them as if they were sitting in front of you and tell them what you want to say. Heal the relationship within yourself. In terms of your physical and mental health, it is just as good as if they were actually sitting before you.<br class="calibre4"/>如果你实际上不能和你名单上的人见面，那就在脑子里想一想。就像他们坐在你面前一样和他们交谈，告诉他们你想说的话。治愈你内心的关系。就你的身体和心理健康而言，就好像他们真的坐在你面前一样。</p>
<p class="calibre9">We need to get rid of pain and anger before we can bring in love. When we hold negative feelings about people in our past, we carry those feelings to those in our present. Not only that, but we can make ourselves physically ill, as some of you may have already experienced. An excellent book to read on the subject of healing your body and mind is Louise Hay’s <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">You Can Heal Your Life.</em> She has many exercises that will help you release the anger, pain, and resentment that you may be carrying around with you.<br class="calibre4"/>在我们带来爱之前，我们需要摆脱痛苦和愤怒。当我们对过去的人抱有负面情绪时，我们就会把这些情绪带给现在的人。不仅如此，我们还会让自己生病，就像你们中的一些人可能已经经历过的那样。路易丝 · 海的《你可以治愈你的生活》是一本关于治愈你的身体和心灵的优秀书籍。她有许多练习可以帮助你释放你可能随身携带的愤怒、痛苦和怨恨。</p>
<p class="calibre9">So many people don’t say thank you because they don’t realize how important their thanks may be. Remember, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">you count and your thanks count.</em> Don’t let an opportunity go by to thank someone who has given you something—anything at all.<br class="calibre4"/>所以很多人不说谢谢，因为他们没有意识到他们的谢谢有多重要。记住，你很重要，你的感谢也很重要。不要错过任何一个感谢别人给予你的机会——任何事情。</p>
<p class="calibre9">If this seems difficult for you right now, start with casual situations, such as saying to someone at work: “Thank you for that” or “I appreciate that” or “Thank you for being happy today; it’s made me happy.” <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Thank you, thank you, thank you.</em> Start getting those words into your consciousness about everyone around you. Start thanking others instead of waiting for thanks to come to you. It is tough in the beginning, but it gets easier. Giving away thanks is like a muscle to be used. As we flex it, it gets stronger. It just takes exercise.<br class="calibre4"/>如果现在这对你来说很难，那就从偶然的场合开始，比如对工作中的某个人说: “谢谢你”或者“我很感激你”或者“谢谢你今天很开心，这让我很开心。”谢谢，谢谢，谢谢。开始让这些话进入你的意识，关于你周围的每一个人。开始感谢别人，而不是等着别人来感谢你。开始的时候很难，但是慢慢会变得容易。表达感谢就像一块需要使用的肌肉。当我们弯曲它的时候，它会变得更强壮。只是需要锻炼。</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">Give Away Information</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
泄露信息
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">So much of what we learn in life comes to us with great difficulty. And, for some reason, we have a tendency to want to see others struggle as much as we did. Turn this around and begin giving others as much help as you can possibly give them. Professionally, this can be very difficult. I can remember times when I felt threatened by those I felt were my “competition,” and the tendency was to withhold information from them that would help them in their work.<br class="calibre4"/>我们在生活中学到的很多东西都是很难得到的。而且，由于某些原因，我们有一种倾向，希望看到别人像我们一样挣扎。把这种情况扭转过来，开始给予他人尽可能多的帮助。从专业角度来说，这是非常困难的。我还记得有些时候，当我感到被那些我认为是我的“竞争对手”所威胁时，我倾向于向他们隐瞒对他们工作有帮助的信息。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Thank goodness, I felt the fear . . . and did it anyway. Some of the people I helped have become my good friends and part of my support system. Here, too, the giving has to be done with no expectations of return. More likely than not, however, the return will be enormous. One of my students asked what would have happened if one of them really had turned against me and used my information in a competitive way. My answer was, and is, that if I have enough belief in myself that I will “make it” no matter what anyone does, what is there to fear? It’s a matter of developing trust in yourself and in your universe. For some reason, when you become a support to others you become bigger than you are. Moreover, when people use what they have learned from you, your effect in this world is greatly magnified.<br class="calibre4"/>谢天谢地，我感受到了恐惧，但我还是做了。我帮助的一些人已经成为了我的好朋友，成为了我支持系统的一部分。在这里，给予也必须在没有期望回报的情况下完成。然而，更有可能的是，回报将是巨大的。我的一个学生问我，如果他们中的一个真的背叛了我，用竞争的方式使用我的信息，会发生什么。我的回答是，如果我对自己有足够的信心，无论别人做什么，我都会“成功”，那还有什么可怕的呢？这是一个发展对自己和你的宇宙的信任的问题。出于某种原因，当你成为别人的支持者时，你会变得比自己更强大。此外，当人们运用他们从你身上学到的东西时，你在这个世界上的影响就会被极大地放大。</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">Give Away Praise</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
给予赞美
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">For many of us, the people we find most difficult to praise are the ones closest to us—our mates, our children, our parents, and sometimes our friends. A lot of the difficulty comes from anger and resentment. Yet, in some strange way, when we praise the people in our lives, we release the negativity and open the door for their being loving toward us.<br class="calibre4"/>对于我们中的许多人来说，我们发现最难表扬的人是我们最亲近的人——我们的伴侣，我们的孩子，我们的父母，有时是我们的朋友。很多困难来自愤怒和怨恨。然而，当我们以某种奇怪的方式赞美生活中的人时，我们释放了消极的一面，为他们对我们的爱敞开了大门。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Too many in relationships focus on the negative, and have no difficulty reminding significant others of what they are doing wrong. It is no wonder so few relationships are going well. We want our loved ones to be affirming and supportive. It is important to surround ourselves with giving, loving, and nurturing people. This implies the flip side of the coin:<br class="calibre4"/>太多的人关注消极的一面，并且毫不费力地提醒重要的人他们做错了什么。难怪这么少的人际关系进展顺利。我们希望我们所爱的人能够肯定和支持我们。重要的是让我们周围都是给予、爱和培养的人。这意味着硬币的另一面:</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">YOU MUST BECOME WHAT YOU WANT TO ATTRACT. </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
你必须成为你想要吸引的人。

<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">BE THE KIND OF PERSON YOU WOULD WANT </strong>

<br class="calibre4"/>
让自己周围都是。
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">One of the doubting Thomases in my class asked me what happens if you give and give and give and get nothing back. I asked her for an example. She said that she gave and gave and gave to a man with whom she was trying to reestablish a relationship, and he refused to come back to her. I think she missed the point. In the first place, she was hardly giving with no expectations. She was expecting a lot! By her own admission, she felt that if she continued to give, he would see what he was missing and would finally come back to her.<br class="calibre4"/>我们班上一个持怀疑态度的托马斯问我，如果你付出了，付出了，付出了，却一无所获，会发生什么。我问她一个例子。她说她给了一个男人一个又一个她试图重新建立关系的男人，但他拒绝回到她身边。我觉得她没有抓住重点。首先，她几乎不是毫无期望地给予。她期待的太多了！她自己也承认，如果自己继续付出，他会看到自己错过了什么，最终会回到自己身边。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I pointed out that it seemed more like a calculated con job, rather than an act of love. I suggested that she needed to release him and move on to someone who could better fill her needs. I reminded her that there is nothing wrong with the giving, but if our needs are not being met in a relationship, it is time to close that door, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">with love</em>, and move on to someone else. Giving does not imply becoming a doormat. We are entitled to have our needs met. However, it doesn’t serve us to be angry if a certain someone does not fulfill them.<br class="calibre4"/>我指出这更像是一个精心策划的骗局，而不是爱的行为。我建议她释放他，找一个能更好地满足她需求的人。我提醒她，给予并没有什么错，但是如果我们的需求在一段关系中得不到满足，那么是时候用爱关上那扇门，向别人走去了。给予并不意味着成为一个受气包。我们有权让我们的需求得到满足。然而，如果某个人没有满足我们的需求，我们也不应该生气。</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">Give Away Time</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
放弃时间
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">Time is something there never seems to be enough of, hence it is one of our most valuable commodities. It is also one of our most precious gifts. How do you give away time? You listen to a friend’s problem, you write a note of thanks, you get involved in something bigger than yourself and become a participating member, you volunteer, you read a book to a child. All of these take you out of yourself and help you operate from a different part of your being—the part that is loving, nurturing, and abundant.<br class="calibre4"/>时间似乎总是不够用，因此它是我们最有价值的商品之一。它也是我们最珍贵的礼物之一。你是如何放弃时间的？你倾听朋友的问题，写一封感谢信，参与比你自己更重要的事情，成为一名参与者，你做志愿者，你给孩子读一本书。所有这些都会让你脱离自我，并帮助你从你存在的另一个不同的部分——那个充满爱、滋养和丰富的部分——运作。</p>
<p class="calibre9">David, one of my students, talked about one of his experiences of giving away his time. He volunteered for The Holiday Project, which involved visiting hospitals at Christmastime. He described it as “an opening up” of his heart and taking it “out of the ordinary and petty into a different space . . . a high place.” Notice what David was feeling from his contribution of time. He remembered singing to a child in a coma. The nurse had told him, “Sing to him . . . he’ll hear you.” He said it was beautiful, and advised the rest of the class to open themselves up to such a contribution. “It’s an incredible high!”<br class="calibre4"/>大卫，我的一个学生，谈到了他的一个经验，放弃了他的时间。他自愿参加了“假日计划”，其中包括在圣诞节期间访问医院。他形容这是一个“打开”他的心，并把它“从平凡和微不足道的进入一个不同的空间... 一个高的地方。”注意大卫对时间的贡献的感受。他记得给一个昏迷的孩子唱歌。护士告诉他: “给他唱歌，他会听到的。”他说这首歌很美，并建议全班同学敞开心扉接受这样的贡献。“这是一种难以置信的高度!”</p>
<p class="calibre9">A dear friend of mine who recently had a stroke felt blessed and abundant at Thanks giving time. He volunteered, wheelchair and all, to help cook Thanks giving dinner in a restaurant that was serving free meals to the homeless. He loved every moment of it. He knows he counts, even after his stroke.<br class="calibre4"/>我的一个好朋友最近中风了，在感恩节这段时间，他感到很幸福，很充实。他自告奋勇，坐着轮椅，帮助做饭。“谢谢”在一家为无家可归者提供免费餐饮的餐馆里做饭。他喜欢这一切的每一刻。他知道他很重要，甚至在他中风之后。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Volunteering is also a wonderful way to spend holidays with your own children. One of my friends was aghast when her daughter, after opening fifty-two presents, said, “Is that all?” That was the last of that kind of Christmas for her daughter. Now, each year she and her daughter are part of the holiday project David talked about, and she has seen a transformation in her daughter. Instead of always wondering what she will be getting for Christmas, her daughter spends a lot of time creating things to take to the hospital and give away.<br class="calibre4"/>做志愿者也是和自己的孩子一起度假的好方法。当我的一个朋友看到她的女儿打开52个礼物后说: “就这些吗?”这是她女儿最后一个这样的圣诞节了。现在，每年她和她的女儿都是大卫所说的节日计划的一部分，她看到了女儿的转变。她的女儿不再总是想着圣诞节会得到什么礼物，而是花费大量时间创造一些东西送到医院，然后送出去。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I want to say a word about volunteering in general. During my years at The Floating Hospital, I had many opportunities to observe volunteers. There were generally two categories: those who knew they counted and those who didn’t. And what a difference there was between them!<br class="calibre4"/>我想谈谈志愿者的一般情况。在我在浮动医院的那些年里，我有很多机会观察志愿者。一般来说有两类人: 知道自己算数的人和不知道自己算数的人。这两者之间的区别是多么大啊！</p>
<p class="calibre9">The latter helped, not out of a sense of giving, but out of a sense of obligation: “I should be giving back to the community.” Some of these used their volunteer experience as a way of proving to everyone else what “good” people they were. This is not to say that some were not of help. They were. Though some definitely were not! Their egos always got in the way. These were the ones who were not interested in what The Floating Hospital needed, but only in what would feed their egos. Hence, they often became more of a problem than a help to the staff. What was worse, they probably derived little sense of satisfaction or personal worth from their experience.<br class="calibre4"/>后者提供帮助，不是出于给予的意识，而是出于责任感: “我应该回馈社会。”其中一些人利用他们的志愿者经历向其他人证明他们是多么“好”的人。这并不是说有些人没有帮助。他们帮助了。虽然有些绝对不是！他们的自负总是妨碍着他们。这些人对浮动医院需要什么不感兴趣，他们只关心如何满足他们的自尊。所以他们经常成为一个问题，而不是一个员工的帮助。更糟糕的是，他们可能很少从自己的经历中获得满足感或个人价值。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Those who knew they counted were a different breed entirely. They were there, silent but sure. They responded to our needs almost before we asked. They were diligent about being on time and never failed to show up when expected. They did anything required of them, no matter how menial it might have seemed. They did it with joy, knowing they were of use. They rarely talked about what they did—they just did it. And they were greatly loved for their contribution.<br class="calibre4"/>那些知道自己算数的人是完全不同的品种。他们就在那里，沉默但是肯定。他们几乎在我们开口之前就对我们的需求做出了回应。他们非常注重准时，从来不会在预期的时间内迟到。他们做任何要求他们做的事情，不管看起来多么卑微。他们满怀喜悦地去做，因为他们知道自己是有用的。他们很少谈论他们做了什么——他们只是做了。他们因为自己的贡献而深受爱戴。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The difference between the way we operate in this world when we know we count and when we don’t know we count is staggering. If you have not yet acknowledged that you count in this world, simply go around “acting as if” you do. Ask yourself, “If I really counted, what would I be doing in this situation? How would I be acting?” It really works.<br class="calibre4"/>在这个世界上，当我们知道我们算数的时候，和不知道我们算数的时候，我们运作的方式之间的差异是惊人的。如果你还没有意识到你在这个世界上也算数，那么你只需要“假装”你算数。问问你自己，“如果我真的数过，在这种情况下我会做什么？我会怎么做?”这真的很有效。</p>
<p class="calibre9">So, knowing that you count, or “acting as if” you do, give away your time. What an incredible gift!<br class="calibre4"/>所以，知道你算数，或者“假装”你算数，就放弃了你的时间。多么不可思议的礼物啊！</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">Give Away Money</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
放弃金钱
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">Money is a huge confrontation for most of us. No matter how successful I become, I have moments when I see myself at the age of eighty-two standing on the corner with a cup in my hand begging for money. I have found that many have this image of themselves. Where this comes from I haven’t the foggiest notion. I have never really wanted for anything in my whole life. Yet the fear persists.<br class="calibre4"/>对我们大多数人来说，金钱是一个巨大的对抗。不管我多么成功，有时候我看到自己82岁的时候，手里拿着一个杯子站在街角乞讨。我发现很多人都有这样的想法。这是从哪里来的，我一点概念都没有。我这辈子从来没有真正想要过什么。然而，恐惧依然存在。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Fear about money often persists regardless of how wealthy we are. I recently read a newspaper account of an immensely rich man who still has nightmares about losing everything. For him, enough will never be enough. Years ago I heard a great line in a B movie: “Security is not having money; it’s knowing you can do without it.” The fact that many of us have never been without money might be the problem. Here is another instance when a lack might have provided a very valuable lesson.<br class="calibre4"/>无论我们多么富有，对金钱的恐惧总是持续存在。我最近在报纸上读到一篇文章，讲的是一个非常富有的人仍然做着失去一切的噩梦。对他来说，永远不会满足。几年前，我在一部 b 级片中听到一句很棒的台词: “安全感不在于有钱，而在于你知道你可以不用钱。”事实上，我们中的许多人从来没有没有钱可能是问题所在。这里有另外一个例子，缺钱可能会提供一个非常有价值的教训。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The answer to an obsession with money lies in loosening up and letting go. Within reason, begin to “give it away” with the belief that you will always find a way to have whatever you need. One friend of mine writes “thank you” on the checks with which she pays her bills. In this attitude, freedom lies—freedom to enjoy, to invest in yourself and others and to be a creative part of the flow. Giving away money can pay off enormously in actual dollars brought in, but, more important, in peace of mind. This is not to say that you should squander your money—balance is the key.<br class="calibre4"/>对金钱的痴迷的答案在于放松和放手。在合理的范围内，开始“放弃它”，相信你总能找到一种方法得到你所需要的一切。我的一个朋友在她用来支付账单的支票上写了“谢谢”。在这种态度下，自由就在于——享受自由，为自己和他人投资，成为创造性的一部分。捐钱可以带来巨大的实际收益，但更重要的是，在内心的平静中。这并不是说你应该浪费你的钱——平衡是关键。</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">Give Away Love</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
放弃爱
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">As far as I am concerned, all of the “give aways” mentioned are about giving away love. But there are other ingredients in loving. For example, when we let someone be who they are without trying to change them, that is giving away love. When we trust that someone can handle his or her own life, and act accordingly, that is giving away love. When we let go and allow others to learn and grow without feeling that our existence is threatened, that is giving away love. How many relationships do you know that look like that?<br class="calibre4"/>就我而言，所有提到的“放弃”都是关于放弃爱。但是爱还有其他的成分。例如，当我们让一个人做他们自己，而不去尝试改变他们的时候，这就是放弃爱。当我们相信一个人能够处理好自己的生活，并采取相应的行动时，这就是放弃爱。当我们放手，允许别人学习和成长而不感到我们的存在受到威胁，那就是放弃爱。你知道有多少种关系是这样的？</p>
<p class="calibre9">What often looks like love is not—it is need. As stated by Rollo May in <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Man’s Search for Himself</em>, “Love is generally confused with dependence; but in point of fact, you can love only in proportion to your capacity for independence.”<br class="calibre4"/>通常看起来像爱的东西其实不是——它是需要。正如罗洛梅在《人类寻找自我》一书中所说，“爱通常与依赖相混淆，但事实上，你只能根据自己的独立能力来爱。”</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">TO LOVE IS TO BE ABLE TO GIVE. </strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
爱就是能够给予。
</p>
<p class="aligncenter"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">AND NOW IS THE TIME TO BEGIN.</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
现在是时候开始了。
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">I’ve discussed giving away thanks, information, praise, time, money, and, now, love. I’m sure you can think of other things to add to the list. You now understand that giving is about outflow. It is about letting go of your crouched, withholding self and standing tall with outstretched arms. When we really feel this sense of abundance, we truly understand the saying “My cup runneth over.”<br class="calibre4"/>我讨论过给予感谢，信息，赞美，时间，金钱，现在，还有爱。我相信你可以想到其他的事情来加入这个列表。你现在明白了，给予是关于流出的。它是关于放开你蜷缩的身体，抑制住自己，张开双臂站得高高的。当我们真正感受到这种富足感时，我们才真正理解“我的杯子满溢”这句话</p>
<p class="calibre9">Giving from the position that “I count” enhances your ability to give. Like any other skill, however, it takes practice.<br class="calibre4"/>从“我数数”的角度给予能够提高你给予的能力。然而，就像其他技能一样，这需要练习。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Whether you presently believe it or not, your life is already abundant. You simply haven’t noticed it. Before you can accept abundance in your life, you have to notice it.<br class="calibre4"/>不管你现在信不信，你的生活已经很充实了。你只是没有注意到而已。在你接受生活中的富足之前，你必须注意到它。</p>
<p class="calibre9">One way to increase your awareness is through what I call The Book of Abundance. Buy yourself a beautiful notebook. Start filling it by listing as many positive things in your life—past and present—as you can think of. Don’t stop until you reach 150. Some of you will find more. When you feel you can’t think of any more, you can. Just keep focusing on all the blessings in your life. No matter how small they seem, include them in your book.<br class="calibre4"/>一种提高你意识的方法就是通过我所说的《富足之书》。给自己买一个漂亮的笔记本。开始把你能想到的过去和现在生活中许多积极的事情列出来填满它。不要停止，直到你达到150。你们中的一些人会发现更多。当你觉得你想不出更多的时候，你可以。只要把注意力集中在你生命中所有的幸福上。不管它们看起来多么微不足道，都要把它们写进你的书里。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Each day make entries in your book. Instead of a traditional diary—which for many is comprised of doom and gloom, wish and want—create this book, which in effect simply states, “I have!” Note every positive thing, large or small, that happens—a compliment from a friend, a cheerful hello from the postman, a beautiful sky, a chance to contribute, a haircut, a new suit, nourishing food. <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">Notice</em> everything wonderful that happens to you.<br class="calibre4"/>每天在你的书里做记录。这本书不是传统的日记——对许多人来说，它由厄运和悲观、希望和渴望组成——而是简单地写着: “我有!”记下每一件发生的积极的事情，无论大小——朋友的赞美，邮递员愉快的问候，美丽的天空，贡献的机会，理发，新衣服，营养的食物。注意所有发生在你身上的美好事物。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Use reminders to keep you focused “on the doughnut, not the hole.” Look for blessings, and you will notice them all over the place. They will envelop you. There is so much you are not seeing that is already there. There is no need to feel scarcity, when there is such abundance.<br class="calibre4"/>使用提醒来让你专注于“甜甜圈，而不是洞”寻找祝福，你会发现它们无处不在。它们会包围你。有太多你没有看到的东西已经在那里了。当有如此丰富的东西时，没有必要感到匮乏。</p>
<p class="calibre9">If you follow these directions, I suspect that you will have a closet full of such books in a very short time. Refer to them often—especially when you are feeling a sense of lack. Lack is only in the mind. Some of the greatest givers I ever met were the poor I met at The Floating Hospital. I watched them and their sense of contribution to the people in their community, and it was joyous. Lack is not about money or things; it is about love. And love is always there for you to create when you are conscious that . . .<br class="calibre4"/>如果你遵循这些指示，我怀疑你将在很短的时间内拥有一个装满此类书籍的壁橱。经常参考它们——尤其是当你感到缺乏的时候。缺乏只存在于头脑中。我遇到的一些最伟大的给予者是我在浮动医院遇到的穷人。我看着他们和他们对社区人民的贡献感，我很高兴。缺乏不是关于金钱或事物，而是关于爱。当你意识到... ... 的时候，爱总是在那里等着你去创造。</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="smallcaps">YOUR LIFE IS ABUNDANT, AND YOU COUNT!</span>
<br class="calibre4"/>
你的生命是丰富的，你是有价值的！
</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">In addition to your Book of Abundance, keep reading positive books, listening to motivational and inspirational audios, and repeating your affirmations. Say to yourself “I RELEASE MY FEAR OF LACK AND ACCEPT THE ABUNDANCE AND PROSPERITY OF THE UNIVERSE,” and whenever you feel fear relative to money, or anything else for that matter, repeat this affirmation. It will give you peace. It will also remind you of the abundance that exists in your life at any given moment.<br class="calibre4"/>除了你的《富足之书》 ，继续阅读积极的书籍，听励志和鼓舞人心的音频，重复你的肯定。对自己说: “我放下对缺乏的恐惧，接受宇宙的富足和繁荣。”无论何时，当你对金钱或其他事物感到恐惧时，重复这句话。它会给你平静。它也会提醒你，在任何特定的时刻，你的生活中存在着丰富多彩的东西。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Keep remembering that you are aiming to get to the point where you are the giver. When you are aware of the fact that “you have,” you can give. When you are a giver, you have nothing to fear. You are powerful and you are loving. The trick in life is not figuring out what you can get, but what you can give. There is so much power in this kind of thinking that it staggers the imagination.<br class="calibre4"/>记住，你的目标是达到你是给予者的地步。当你意识到“你拥有”这个事实时，你就可以给予。当你是一个给予者，你就没有什么可害怕的了。你充满力量，你充满爱。生活的诀窍不是弄清楚你能得到什么，而是你能给予什么。这种想法蕴含着巨大的力量，令人难以想象。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Think about this: If you see that your purpose in life is to give, then it’s almost impossible to be conned. If someone takes, they are simply fulfilling your life’s purpose, and they deserve your thanks. When you act the giving adult, your fears are diminished . . . you realize you are meant to be used.<br class="calibre4"/>想想这个: 如果你明白你的人生目标是给予，那么你几乎不可能被骗。如果有人索取，他们只是完成了你的人生目标，他们应该得到你的感谢。当你表现得像个乐于奉献的成年人时，你的恐惧就会减少... ... 你会意识到你注定要被利用。</p>
<p class="calibre9">George Bernard Shaw summed it up beautifully in the quotation below. Reading these words daily will greatly help you to put things in perspective and give you the courage to move beyond your fear, so that you can be of great use to the world:<br class="calibre4"/>萧伯纳(george bernard shaw)在下面的引用中美妙地总结了这一点。每天阅读这些文字将极大地帮助你正确地看待事物，给你勇气克服恐惧，这样你就能对世界有很大的用处:</p>
<blockquote class="calibre6">
<p class="noindent">This is the true joy in life, the being used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one, the being a force of nature instead of a feverish selfish little clod of ailments and grievances complaining that the world will not devote itself to making me happy.<br class="calibre4"/>这才是生活中真正的快乐，被自己认为是一个伟大的目标所利用，成为自然的力量，而不是一个自私自利的发烧的疾病和怨恨的小块，抱怨这个世界不会致力于让我快乐。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I am of the opinion that my life belongs to the whole community and, as long as I live, it is my privilege to do for it whatever I can. I want to be thoroughly used up when I die, for the harder I work the more I live.<br class="calibre4"/>我认为我的生命属于整个社会，只要我还活着，我就有权为它做任何我能做的事情。我希望在我死的时候被彻底地消耗掉，因为我越努力工作，我活得越久。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I rejoice in life for its own sake. Life is no brief candle to me. It is a sort of splendid torch which I’ve got to hold up for the moment and I want to make it burn as brightly as possible before handing it on to future generations.<br class="calibre4"/>我为生活本身而高兴。生活对我来说不是一支短暂的蜡烛。这是一个辉煌的火炬，我必须举起它的时刻，我想让它尽可能明亮地燃烧，然后把它传递给后代。</p>
