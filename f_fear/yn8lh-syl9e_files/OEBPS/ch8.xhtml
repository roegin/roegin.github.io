<p class="noindent"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="drop">“I</span> am devastated without Jim. He was my whole life!” Louise was one of my students, and her husband had just divorced her after five years of marriage. She wasn’t kidding when she said that Jim was her whole life, for that’s exactly what she had made him. Nothing or no one else had any real significance.<br class="calibre4"/>没有吉姆我很难过。他是我的全部!”路易丝是我的一个学生，她的丈夫在结婚五年后刚刚和她离婚。当她说吉姆是她的全部时，她并不是在开玩笑，因为那正是她造就了吉姆。没有任何东西或者任何人有任何真正的意义。</p>
<p class="calibre9">This, of course, explains her devastation and desperate sense of emptiness when he left. It probably also explains, in part, the breakdown of the marriage. As I illustrate in <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">The Feel the Fear Guide to Lasting Love,</em> dependency in a relationship creates some very unattractive side effects—anger, jealousy, resentment, clinging, nagging—all very unpleasant to live with. These self-defeating qualities are the result of a deep-seated fear of losing that which we see as the basis of our entire identity.<br class="calibre4"/>当然，这也解释了为什么当他离开时，她感到绝望和空虚。这也可能部分解释了婚姻破裂的原因。正如我在《持久爱情的恐惧指南》中所阐述的那样，恋爱中的依赖会产生一些非常不吸引人的副作用——愤怒、嫉妒、怨恨、执着、唠叨——所有这些都让人生活非常不愉快。这些自我挫败的品质是对失去我们认为是我们整个身份基础的东西的根深蒂固的恐惧的结果。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Bob, a public-relations executive, chose to create his identity in the area of <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">work.</em> For him, there was only his career; nothing else mattered. As with Louise, negative side effects accompanied his emotional dependency. At work, he was protective instead of expansive and giving; he usurped credit for everything, ignoring the contributions of those with whom he worked; and in his constant attempt to gain approval from his superiors, he never took a chance. Thus his creativity was greatly diminished.<br class="calibre4"/>公共关系主管鲍勃选择在工作领域创造自己的身份。对他来说，只有他的事业，其他的一切都不重要。和路易丝一样，负面的副作用伴随着他的情感依赖。在工作中，他是保护性的，而不是扩张性的和给予性的; 他篡夺了所有事情的荣誉，忽略了和他一起工作的那些人的贡献; 在他不断试图获得上司的认可时，他从来没有抓住机会。因此，他的创造力大大减弱了。</p>
<p class="calibre9">When he lost his job because of a series of cutbacks, he predictably experienced a feeling of devastation, an extreme sense of helplessness, and thoughts of suicide—all brought on by a horrible feeling of emptiness. His lifeline had been severed.<br class="calibre4"/>当他因为一系列的裁员而失去工作时，他不出所料地经历了一种毁灭感、一种极端的无助感和自杀的想法——所有这些都是由一种可怕的空虚感引起的。他的生命线被切断了。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Men and an increasing number of women who have lived their entire adult years emotionally tied to their work often fall apart when they are forced to retire. It is as though their lives are over—in fact, many die soon after their retirement begins. How sad that they cannot enjoy what is potentially the most enjoyable and creative part of their lives!<br class="calibre4"/>男子和越来越多的妇女在成年后的整个生活中都与工作有着情感上的联系，当他们被迫退休时，他们往往分崩离析。这就好像他们的生命结束了一样——事实上，许多人在退休后不久就去世了。他们不能享受他们生命中潜在的最有趣和最有创造力的部分，这是多么可悲啊！</p>
<p class="calibre9">Jeanne, a housewife, made her <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">children</em> the totality of her life. To those who didn’t understand, she looked like, and believed herself to be, a “good” mother. She was always there when the children came home from school, she catered to their every need, and she prided herself on the fact that her children always came first.<br class="calibre4"/>珍妮，一个家庭主妇，把她的孩子当作她生命的全部。对于那些不理解她的人来说，她看起来像，并且相信自己是一个“好”妈妈。当孩子们放学回家时，她总是在那里，她满足他们的一切需要，她为自己的孩子总是第一感到骄傲。</p>
<p class="calibre9">If Jeanne had been more honest with herself, she would have seen she was using her children to create her reason to exist. Those who really knew her were aware of the inevitable side effects—a need to dominate, overprotectiveness, self-righteousness, and the creation of massive amounts of guilt in her children. She never let them forget what a giving person she was. When they grew up and eventually went off on their own, Jeanne faced what she perceived as a totally empty house— despite the fact that she and her husband still lived there. This mirrored the total emptiness she felt inside. Staying home with children is not inherently bad. However, when parents depend on children for their own emotional survival, it is clearly detrimental. Not only is it unhealthy for the parent, it is also unhealthy for the children. A parent’s survival is a heavy burden for a child to bear!<br class="calibre4"/>如果珍妮对自己更诚实一些，她就会发现她是在利用她的孩子们来创造她存在的理由。那些真正了解她的人意识到了不可避免的副作用——控制欲、过度保护、自以为是，以及在她的孩子身上制造大量的罪恶感。她从不让他们忘记她是一个多么乐于奉献的人。当他们长大并最终独立生活时，珍妮看到的是一座空荡荡的房子，尽管她和丈夫仍然住在那里。这反映了她内心的空虚。和孩子呆在家里本身并不是坏事。然而，当父母为了自己的情感生存而依赖孩子时，这显然是有害的。这不仅对父母是不健康的，对孩子也是不健康的。父母的生存对孩子来说是一个沉重的负担！</p>
<p class="calibre9">The underlying feeling that Louise, Bob, and Jeanne shared was an extreme sense of neediness. When they lost the things in their lives to which they were emotionally tied, this neediness was exposed. I will wager that most of you, at some time or another, have experienced this same kind of neediness. If so, you will agree it is one of the most painful feelings you can experience. And to make matters worse, when you are in the throes of desperation, there seems to be little you can do to make yourself feel better.<br class="calibre4"/>露易丝、鲍勃和珍妮共有的潜在感觉是一种极端的需求感。当他们失去了生活中与他们情感相连的东西时，这种需求就暴露了出来。我敢打赌，你们中的大多数人，在某个时候，都经历过这种需求。如果是这样，你会同意这是你能经历的最痛苦的感觉之一。更糟糕的是，当你在绝望的痛苦中挣扎时，你似乎无法让自己感觉更好。</p>
<p class="calibre9">This raises a question: Is there anything that can be done to help loosen the grip of this intense neediness, that can make us feel whole despite a great loss in our life? If there is, imagine how greatly our fear of loss could be diminished. The answer to this question is undeniably YES! That should come as a relief.<br class="calibre4"/>这就提出了一个问题: 有没有什么办法可以帮助我们放松这种强烈的需求，让我们在生命中遭受巨大损失的情况下感到完整？如果有的话，想象一下我们对失去的恐惧可以减少多少。这个问题的答案毫无疑问是肯定的！这应该是一种解脱。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Although you should be ecstatic that relief is possible, it is important to keep in mind that, as with everything else associated with change, it takes a great deal of awareness, patience, and perseverance to break strong emotion-backed patterns. This should not worry you. While it may sound like an unpleasant task, it really isn’t, <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">if</em> you take it in small and manageable steps and allow yourself time to really enjoy the process.<br class="calibre4"/>虽然你应该欣喜若狂，因为可以得到解脱，但是重要的是要记住，和其他与改变相关的事情一样，打破强烈的情感支持模式需要大量的意识、耐心和毅力。这不应该让你担心。虽然这听起来像是一项令人不快的任务，但如果你以小的、可管理的步骤来完成它，并且给自己时间真正享受这个过程，那么事实并非如此。</p>
<p class="calibre9">So I invite you to try an alternate way of handling your life; it is geared toward helping you release the desperation, emptiness, and fear that may be attached to certain aspects of your life. I know from my own experience that this release is possible. This chapter spells out the steps necessary for change. I promise you these steps offer some interesting insights. Yet only through action and commitment can they become powerful tools that will absolutely change the quality of your life.<br class="calibre4"/>因此，我邀请你尝试另一种方式来处理你的生活，它是为了帮助你释放绝望、空虚和恐惧，这些可能会伴随着你生活的某些方面。我从自己的经历中知道，这种释放是可能的。这一章详细阐述了改变的必要步骤。我向你保证，这些步骤提供了一些有趣的见解。然而，只有通过行动和承诺，它们才能成为强大的工具，绝对会改变你的生活质量。</p>
<p class="calibre9">It will be helpful for you to first understand more clearly what I consider to be the cause of the emptiness you feel when your life is out of balance. Using RELATIONSHIP as an example, the following illustrates what your Whole Life looks like when you focus emotionally on only one area:<br class="calibre4"/>当你的生活失去平衡的时候，我认为是什么造成了你的空虚，这将有助于你首先更清楚地理解。以人际关系为例，下面的例子说明了当你情感上只专注于一个领域时，你的整个生活是什么样子的:</p>
<div class="centeredimage"><div class="calibre4"><img alt="17whlifewith.jpg" id="img18" src="image/17whlifewith.jpg" class="calibre20"/></div></div>
<p class="noindent">If, as in Louise’s case, the big R disappears, life suddenly looks like this:<br class="calibre4"/>如果像 Louise 那样，大 r 消失了，生活突然变成了这样:</p>
<div class="centeredimage"><div class="calibre4"><img alt="18whlifewo.jpg" id="img19" src="image/18whlifewo.jpg" class="calibre20"/></div></div>
<p class="noindent">No wonder you feel empty! No wonder you have the urge to replace that relationship immediately! There’s nothing left!<br class="calibre4"/>难怪你会感到空虚，难怪你会迫切地想要立刻换掉这段感情，一切都没有了！</p>
<p class="calibre9">It doesn’t have to be this way. Look at the following Whole Life, which represents an entirely different way of seeing things:<br class="calibre4"/>没必要这样。看看下面的 Whole Life，它代表了一种完全不同的看待事物的方式:</p>
<div class="centeredimage"><div class="calibre4"><img alt="19whlifewith2.jpg" id="img20" src="image/19whlifewith2.jpg" class="calibre10"/></div></div>
<p class="noindent">This represents the Whole Life of another one of my students, Nancy. Taking the form of a grid instead of a vacuous box, life looks amazingly different for Nancy than for poor Louise, Bob, and Jeanne. Not only is Nancy’s grid filled with nourishment and aliveness, but the entire <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">area</em> of her Life seems to have increased, which, in effect, gives her more for her money. Let’s assume that Nancy, too, experiences the loss of her love. What does her Whole Life look like then? What a difference compared with Louise’s loss! You will notice from the following grid that the loss of Nancy’s relationship leaves a hole. But it hardly wipes her out! Yes, there was pain when Nancy split from her boyfriend; yes, she is lonely at times; and yes, she would like to eventually have a successful relationship. Yet, without it, her life still works beautifully. Each day is filled with a multitude of experiences that bring her joy and satisfaction; hence, her neediness is gone. There are so many resources available to her that she truly feels as if life is a giant cornucopia that will never be empty.<br class="calibre4"/>这代表了我的另一个学生南希的整个人生。南希的生活与可怜的路易丝、鲍勃和珍妮的生活截然不同。不仅南希的栅格充满了营养和活力，而且她生活的整个领域似乎都增加了，这实际上给了她更多的钱。让我们假设南希也经历了失去爱的痛苦。那么她的整个人生是什么样子的呢？和路易丝的损失相比，这是多么不同啊！你会从下面的网格中注意到，失去南希的关系留下了一个洞。但这并不能抹杀她！是的，南希和男朋友分手的时候很痛苦; 是的，她有时很孤独; 是的，她希望最终能有一段成功的感情。然而，如果没有这段感情，她的生活仍然很美好。每一天都充满了各种各样的经历，这些经历给她带来了快乐和满足; 因此，她的需求也就消失了。她可以利用的资源是如此之多，以至于她真的觉得生活就像一个巨大的聚宝盆，永远不会空虚。</p>
<div class="centeredimage"><div class="calibre4"><img alt="20whlifewo2.jpg" id="img21" src="image/20whlifewo2.jpg" class="calibre10"/></div></div>
<p class="noindent">At this point in one of my classes a student piped up to say that she, too, has many things in her life—family, children, job, friends—but the only thing that <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">means</em> anything to her is relationship. I pointed out that this is where the awareness, perseverance, and patience come in—to enhance the <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">commitment</em> she has to each area of her life.<br class="calibre4"/>此时，在我的一个班级里，一个学生高声说道，她的生活中也有很多东西——家庭、孩子、工作、朋友——但对她来说唯一有意义的东西就是人际关系。我指出，这就是意识、毅力和耐心出现的地方——来增强她对生活中每个领域的承诺。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Commitment, as I am using the term, means consciously giving 100%—everything you’ve got—to each “box” of the grid. For example, when you are at work, work full out, holding nothing back; when you are with your family, consciously be <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">with</em> them, 100%; when you are with friends, be there 100% . . . and so on.<br class="calibre4"/>承诺，正如我使用的术语，意味着有意识地付出100% ——你所拥有的一切——给网格中的每一个“盒子”。例如，当你在工作时，全力以赴，毫无保留; 当你和家人在一起时，有意识地100% 和他们在一起; 当你和朋友在一起时，100% 和他们在一起... ... 等等。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As I started explaining commitment to my class, Sandy, another student, immediately responded that her job was only temporary, until she found something better. In the meantime, she was bored out of her mind and couldn’t wait to leave it. Therefore, how could she possibly commit herself to being there 100%? I explained that commitment doesn’t mean that it has to last forever, but <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">while you are there,</em> commit yourself 100%. By doing this, the quality of your life will improve 100%.<br class="calibre4"/>当我开始解释我对班级的承诺时，另一名学生桑迪立即回答说，她的工作只是暂时的，直到她找到了更好的工作。与此同时，她觉得无聊透顶，迫不及待地想离开这份工作。所以，她怎么可能百分之百的投入？我解释说，承诺并不意味着它必须永远持续下去，但是当你在那里的时候，100% 地承诺自己。通过这样做，你的生活质量将得到100% 的提高。</p>
<p class="calibre9">I gave her a tool to use on the job to enhance the concept of commitment. This tool is to <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">“act as if “ you really count.</em> What would that look like? What would she be doing if she knew she really counted? Some possibilities the class came up with were: creating daily goals and seeing that they are completed, interacting with other staff members in a way that would make their day happier, and creating an environment that is a pleasure to work in. She added, “I would also get there on time.” Sandy promised she would give it a try after I assured her that committing herself to this job would not mean that she would be there forever.<br class="calibre4"/>我给了她一个工具，让她在工作中使用，以增强承诺的概念。这个工具就是“表现得好像”你真的很重要。这看起来像什么？如果她知道自己真的算数了，她会怎么做？这门课提出的一些可能性包括: 制定每日目标，确保目标完成; 与其他员工进行互动，使他们的一天更快乐; 创造一个愉快的工作环境。她补充说，“我也会准时到达那里。”在我向桑迪保证她全身心投入这份工作并不意味着她会永远在那里工作之后，桑迪承诺她会尝试一下。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Sandy returned to class the following week very excited about what had transpired. We were all struck by the increased level of her energy. She reported that she had taken a plant and a painting to work, which immediately brightened her little area. She was complimentary and helpful to the people around her, and each night before she left the office she created goals to complete the following day. As each day progressed, she focused on her goals and was amazed to find that she now got twice as much done each day. She got addicted to the act of checking off her goals—it felt so good. When on the rare occasion she didn’t get to something on the list, she merely carried it over to the next day.<br class="calibre4"/>第二个星期，桑迪回到班上，对所发生的事情感到非常兴奋。我们都被她精力充沛的表现所震惊。她报告说，她带了一株植物和一幅画去工作，这立刻照亮了她的小区域。她对周围的人赞美有加，乐于助人，每天晚上离开办公室前，她都为第二天的工作制定目标。随着时间的推移，她专注于自己的目标，并惊奇地发现自己现在每天完成的工作量是以前的两倍。她沉迷于完成自己的目标，这种感觉太棒了。在极少数情况下，她没有完成清单上的任务，她只是把它带到了第二天。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Sandy was amazed at the response. One of her co-workers actually asked her what she was on, and said, “Whatever it is, continue taking it!” But the magical result was that <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">she actually began to enjoy her job.</em> Participating 100% eliminates boredom. Once Sandy got over her “woe-is-me” attitude and began to choose to be there 100%, a feeling of satisfaction and aliveness resulted. Her “acting as if” she counts is creating other benefits as well: increased self-esteem, a good reference when she finally does move on to another job, and the realization that she actually can make a difference. This, of course, makes her feel more powerful in a world where so many people feel helpless.<br class="calibre4"/>桑迪对这样的反应感到惊讶。实际上，她的一个同事问她在吃什么，并说: “不管是什么，继续服用!”但是神奇的结果是，她开始享受她的工作。100% 的参与消除了无聊。一旦桑迪克服了她的“悲哀是我”的态度，并开始选择在那里100% ，一种满足感和活力产生了。她认为，她的“表现得好像”也带来了其他好处: 增强了自尊心，当她最终跳槽时，这是一个很好的参考，她意识到自己实际上可以有所作为。当然，这让她在一个很多人感到无助的世界里感到更加强大。</p>
<p class="calibre9">To make commitment a less heavy concept, keep in mind that, contrary to what we have been taught, it doesn’t necessarily mean forever.<br class="calibre4"/>为了使承诺成为一个不那么沉重的概念，请记住，与我们被教导的相反，它并不一定意味着永远。</p>
<p class="calibre9">For example, my job as the executive director of The Floating Hospital brought me a great deal of joy and satisfaction, but after eight years I began to feel that I was ready for another kind of challenge. Since I was totally committed to The Floating Hospital, I was determined that it would operate just as smoothly after my departure as before. I began breaking in someone to replace me. I began delegating more and more. I gradually familiarized the board of trustees with the new person I thought would be perfect for the job. I prepared everyone for my leaving. So you see that, even though I was on my way out, I was committed to that job 100%.<br class="calibre4"/>例如，我作为“浮动医院”的执行董事给我带来了巨大的快乐和满足感，但是八年之后，我开始觉得我已经准备好迎接另一种挑战。因为我全身心地投入到浮动医院中，我决心在我离开之后，它会像以前一样顺利地运作。我开始找人代替我。我开始委派越来越多的任务。我逐渐让董事会熟悉了我认为最适合这份工作的新人。我让每个人都为我的离开做好了准备。所以你看，即使我已经离开了，我还是百分之百的忠于那份工作。</p>
<p class="calibre9">At the same time, I was totally committed to having my life work after I left my job. In my free hours, I began teaching, writing, and increasing my private psychotherapy practice. In two years, the groundwork had been laid for the future of both The Floating Hospital and my new career. I was ready to leave.<br class="calibre4"/>同时，我完全致力于我的生活工作后，我离开了我的工作。在我的空闲时间里，我开始教书，写作，增加我的私人心理治疗实践。在两年的时间里，我为“漂浮医院”和我的新职业生涯的未来打下了基础。我准备离开。</p>
<p class="calibre9">The same principle works in the area of relationship. No one really knows how long any given relationship will last. But until you decide to let it go, it is important that you give your mate and yourself the respect and dignity you both deserve by committing yourself to be there 100%. If the day arises when you know that it is time to split, you will know that you gave it everything you had. And if, for some reason, your mate decides to end the relationship, you will know that you did your best. There is nothing to regret. If you have already incorporated the grid concept into your life, the loss will not be enormous, since you have so many other areas of nourishment in your life.<br class="calibre4"/>同样的原则也适用于人际关系领域。没有人真正知道任何特定的关系会持续多久。但是在你决定放手之前，重要的是你要给你的伴侣和你自己你们都应得的尊重和尊严，你要承诺自己100% 在那里。如果有一天你知道是时候分手了，你就会知道你已经付出了一切。如果，出于某种原因，你的伴侣决定结束这段关系，你会知道你已经尽力了。没什么好后悔的。如果你已经将网格概念融入到你的生活中，这种损失将不会很大，因为你的生活中还有很多其他方面的营养。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">One area of the grid needs some explanation: the area of CONTRIBUTION. This is the area that allows you to make your own special difference in the world. Contribution is discussed in a later chapter; for now, simply note that it is from the area of Contribution that much of your self-esteem and satisfaction in life can come. To know that you can make a difference in this world means that you are not helpless, that you are a meaningful force in the world.<br class="calibre4"/>网格的一个区域需要一些解释: CONTRIBUTION 区域。这个区域允许你在这个世界上做出自己独特的贡献。贡献将在后面的章节中讨论; 现在，简单地注意到，正是从贡献这个领域，你的自尊和满足感才能在生活中得到很大程度的提升。知道你可以在这个世界上有所作为意味着你不是无助的，你是这个世界上有意义的力量。</p>
<p class="calibre9">It is important that you don’t think of contribution in such grand terms as those of Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr., or Albert Einstein. Contribution in the way that I am using it means being exactly where you are, looking around, seeing what needs to be done, and doing it. This could relate to your family, your friends, your community, your country, and the world. There is not a person alive who is not capable of greatly contributing to the well-being of this planet. Just changing your attitude can affect the world around you.<br class="calibre4"/>重要的是，你不要把贡献想得像甘地、马丁 · 路德 · 金或爱因斯坦那样宏大。我所使用的贡献方式意味着站在你所在的位置，环顾四周，看看需要做什么，然后去做。这可以关系到你的家庭，你的朋友，你的社区，你的国家和世界。没有一个活着的人不能为这个星球的幸福做出巨大的贡献。仅仅改变你的态度就能影响你周围的世界。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Now that you understand the concept of the grid and recognize its importance in reducing many of your fears regarding relationship, job, children, and so on, you are ready to take steps to incorporate this powerful tool into your daily life. Here are the steps:<br class="calibre4"/>既然你已经理解了网格的概念，并且认识到了它在减少你对人际关系、工作、孩子等问题的恐惧方面的重要性，那么你就准备采取措施将这个强大的工具融入到你的日常生活中。以下是步骤:</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">1. Simply recognize that you might be caught in a vicious cycle. If you look carefully at your past, you will probably notice that every time negative feelings associated with loss came up, you took the very same pathway to try to relieve the discomfort: You tried to re-create that which you had lost.<br class="calibre4"/>1.只要意识到你可能会陷入恶性循环。如果你仔细审视你的过去，你可能会注意到，每次与失去有关的负面情绪出现时，你都会采取同样的方式来试图减轻不适: 你试图重新创造你已经失去的东西。</p>
<p class="calibre9">For example, what’s the first thing many of us do when we are devastated by the loss of a loved one? We simply substitute heads. And when the next love of our life leaves, we experience the same feeling of devastation (which is amazing, since we’ve only known this lover for three weeks). Then what do we do? It’s not hard to guess—we go out and find another “one and only” without whom we would simply die!<br class="calibre4"/>例如，当我们失去所爱的人时，我们许多人做的第一件事是什么？我们只是简单地用头来代替。当我们生命中的下一个爱人离开时，我们也会经历同样的毁灭感(这很神奇，因为我们只认识这个爱人三个星期)。然后我们该怎么办？这并不难猜——我们出去寻找另一个“独一无二”的人，没有他，我们只会死！</p>
<p class="calibre9">If this or a similar pattern sounds familiar, it is important not to make a big thing out of it. Just recognize that up until now you simply did not have an appropriate framework within which to create a healthier way to act. The mere fact that you acknowledge the possibility of another way is enough to get you to the next step.<br class="calibre4"/>如果这个或类似的模式听起来很熟悉，重要的是不要小题大做。只要认识到到目前为止你还没有一个合适的框架来创造一个更健康的行为方式。仅仅是你认识到另一种方式的可能性就足以让你迈出下一步。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">2. Create your own Whole Life Grid. Begin by making a nine-box square like the one on the following page.<br class="calibre4"/>2. 创建你自己的整个生活网格。开始做一个九个方框的正方形，就像下面页面上的那个。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Take some time to think about what components you would like to include in your life and begin filling in the boxes. I am a great believer in setting the stage whenever I begin any kind of introspection, so I recommend that you play some calming music in the background while you are filling in the boxes. Make sure you are alone and that the phone is turned off.<br class="calibre4"/>花点时间想想你想在你的生活中包括哪些组件，然后开始填写这些盒子。每当我开始任何形式的自我反省时，我都坚信要搭建舞台，所以我建议你在填写框子的时候，在背景音乐中播放一些平静的音乐。确保你是独自一人，并且关掉手机。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">3. After you have filled in your grid, pick one of the boxes to work on. Shut your eyes and visualize what you would like that part of your life to look like. What would you be doing? How would you be interacting with the people around you? How would it feel? Remember the two key ingredients: 100%<br class="calibre4"/>3.在你填充完你的网格后，选择一个盒子进行工作。闭上你的眼睛，想象你希望你生活的那部分是什么样子。你会做什么？你将如何与周围的人互动？感觉如何？记住两个关键因素: 100% </p>
<div class="centeredimage"><div class="calibre4"><img alt="21perwhlife.jpg" id="img22" src="image/21perwhlife.jpg" class="calibre10"/></div></div>
<p class="noindent">commitment and acting as if you count. Let’s call them the MAGIC DUO, for that’s exactly what they create in your life— magic.<br class="calibre4"/>承诺和表现得好像你很重要。让我们称他们为魔术二人组，因为这正是他们在你的生活中创造的东西——魔术。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">4. When you get a clear picture, take a blank piece of paper and begin writing down what your mind created for you, paying attention to all the details. This will help you with Step 5.<br class="calibre4"/>4.当你得到一个清晰的画面，拿一张空白的纸，开始写下你的头脑为你创造的东西，注意所有的细节。这将帮助你完成第五步。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">5. List the many things that would have to be done in order to make your visualization become a reality. Again, take time to think this through carefully. I cannot repeat too frequently:<br class="calibre4"/>5.列出为了让你的想象成为现实而必须做的许多事情。同样，花点时间仔细考虑一下。我不能重复得太频繁:</p>
<p class="spaceabove"><strong xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7">ACTION IS THE KEY TO YOUR SUCCESS.</strong>
<br class="calibre4"/>
行动是你成功的关键。
</p>
<p class="noindent1">You have to <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">do</em> something to make your real life match your visualization. So your actions are critical.<br class="calibre4"/>你必须做一些事情使你的现实生活符合你的想象。所以你的行动是至关重要的。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Let’s see how this might actually work. If you had picked the area PERSONAL GROWTH, you might see yourself taking classes and workshops, reading books, and attending lectures. In your visualization, the Magic Duo assures that you will approach all of this with a will that keeps you focused, and also assures your active participation at all times.<br class="calibre4"/>让我们看看这到底是怎么回事。如果你选择了个人成长这个领域，你可能会看到自己参加课程和研讨会，阅读书籍，参加讲座。在你的想象中，魔术二人组保证你将以一种让你集中注意力的意志来处理所有这些问题，同时也保证你在任何时候都积极参与。</p>
<p class="calibre9">If you are in a workshop, you might see yourself interacting with the other students, doing all the homework, whether it is a credit course or not, happily anticipating the next class and really happy that you have chosen to be there.<br class="calibre4"/>如果你在一个工作室，你可能会看到自己和其他学生互动，做所有的家庭作业，不管是不是学分课程，高兴地期待着下一堂课，真的很高兴你选择在那里。</p>
<p class="calibre9">By the way, when you take this concept into the real world, old habits will emerge—that’s a given! Thus, when you are actually at a workshop, you might suddenly be overcome by the wish that you were with <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">him.</em> In the beginning, your mind will <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">definitely, without a question</em>, want to pull you out of your commitment, and it will take your constant vigilance to control the wandering. Eventually you will be able to say, “The heck with him—I’m here to learn!” Imagine what this does for your self-esteem! Eventually you will be able to make your mind focus on the matter at hand and take in what is happening around you. And then guess what happens! The neediness begins to disappear. The problem with needy people is that they can’t take in anything around them. Then they wonder why they are starving emotionally.<br class="calibre4"/>顺便说一句，当你把这个概念带到现实世界时，旧习惯就会出现——这是肯定的！因此，当你实际上在一个工作室，你可能会突然被你和他在一起的愿望所征服。开始的时候，你的大脑肯定会毫无疑问地想要把你从你的承诺中拉出来，并且需要你时刻保持警惕来控制这种游荡。最终你会说: “去他的，我是来学习的!”想象一下这对你的自尊有什么好处！最终，你将能够让你的思想集中在手头的事情上，接受你周围正在发生的事情。然后猜猜会发生什么！需求开始消失。需要帮助的人的问题在于他们无法接受身边的任何东西。然后他们想知道为什么他们在情感上感到饥饿。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">What about the area of FRIENDS? What would that look like? Here, you might see yourself inviting them over for dinner, creating a terrific evening out, writing them letters of appreciation, or simply calling them and telling them you were thinking about them. In the real world, when with your friends you will probably wish you were with your one and only. This is the time to call in the Magic Duo. Begin by focusing on your commitment to be a wonderful friend, “acting as if” you truly make a difference in their lives. From that mental place, you will begin to find much pleasure and fulfillment.<br class="calibre4"/>那么朋友这一块呢？那会是什么样子？在这里，你可能会邀请他们共进晚餐，创造一个美妙的夜晚，给他们写感谢信，或者干脆打电话告诉他们你在想他们。在现实世界中，当你和你的朋友在一起时，你可能会希望你和你唯一的朋友在一起。现在是时候召唤魔力二人组了。首先，专注于你对成为一个好朋友的承诺，“表现得好像”你真的对他们的生活产生了影响。从这种精神状态，你会开始找到许多快乐和满足感。</p>
<p class="calibre9">When I was a young woman, my friends and I had an unwritten contract: “I’ll keep my date with you as long as Mr. Wonderful doesn’t call.” Although everyone seemed to have understood the rule, looking back I consider it a lousy policy—stupid, as well, since I always had such a great time with my girlfriends. As I matured I stopped treating my friends with such disrespect. An interesting side effect was that I ceased being considered a last-minute date by the male population. The men in my life began phoning days and sometimes weeks in advance when they knew I would not cancel other commitments to be with them.<br class="calibre4"/>当我还是个年轻女人的时候，我和我的朋友们有一个不成文的约定: “只要奇妙先生不打电话来，我就继续和你约会。”虽然每个人似乎都明白这个规则，但回顾过去，我认为这是一个糟糕的政策——也很愚蠢，因为我总是和我的女朋友们玩得很开心。随着我的成熟，我不再对我的朋友如此不尊重。一个有趣的副作用是，我不再被男性群体视为最后一刻的约会对象。我生命中的男人开始提前几天甚至几个星期打电话给我，因为他们知道我不会取消和他们在一起的其他约会。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">Let’s look at the area of LEISURE. This one stumps a lot of my students, and I admit it is an area I must work on daily. Many of us tend to be achievement-oriented and get anxious when taking time to relax and enjoy ourselves. It seems to be okay when you’re relaxing with your mate or friends, but when on your own, you feel you should be accomplishing something. Again, the way to release this anxiety is to call upon the Magic Duo. By committing yourself 100% to your relaxation and “acting as if” your well-being counts, you can enjoy taking some time alone for yourself.<br class="calibre4"/>让我们来看看休闲的领域。这个问题困扰了我的很多学生，我承认这是我每天必须努力解决的一个领域。我们中的许多人倾向于以成就为导向，并且在花时间放松和享受自己的时候变得焦虑。当你和你的伴侣或朋友一起放松的时候看起来没什么问题，但是当你独自一人的时候，你会觉得你应该完成一些事情。再次强调，释放这种焦虑的方法就是召唤魔法二人组。通过100% 的放松和“假装”你的幸福很重要，你可以享受一些独处的时间。</p>
<p class="calibre9">To help myself out, I’ve created the concept of the holihour, a shortened version of the holi-day. I allow myself at least an hour each day to relax totally. It could mean reading magazines, walking on the beach, or shopping in my favorite mall. This helps greatly in keeping me refreshed in my work. Very often I get some of my best ideas during leisure time, when my mind is not so cluttered.<br class="calibre4"/>为了帮助自己，我创造了一个节日的概念，一个节日的缩短版本。我允许自己每天至少有一个小时完全放松。这可能意味着阅读杂志，在海滩上散步，或者在我最喜欢的购物中心购物。这极大地帮助我在工作中保持精力充沛。很多时候，当我的大脑不那么杂乱的时候，我会在闲暇时间得到一些最好的想法。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">6. Do steps 3, 4, and 5 for every area of your grid. You will be amazed at what a beautiful life begins to emerge—so rich, full, loving, and giving. It is important to keep in mind that whatever you create in your grid can become a reality—if you are committed to taking the necessary action.<br class="calibre4"/>6.对网格中的每个区域执行步骤3、4和5。你会惊讶于一个美丽的生活开始出现——如此丰富、充实、充满爱和付出。重要的是要记住，如果你决心采取必要的行动，你在你的网格中创造的任何东西都可以成为现实。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">7. Each day, create for yourself specific goals that reflect all the boxes in your grid. If you are already a diligent daily goal setter, you will probably notice that your goals are focused in only one area of your life—most likely WORK. By setting goals for all areas of your grid, your life will become balanced.<br class="calibre4"/>7.每一天，为你自己创建一个特定的目标，这个目标要反映出你网格中所有的方块。如果你已经是一个勤奋的每日目标设定者，你可能会注意到你的目标只集中在你生活的一个领域——最有可能是工作。通过为你生活的各个方面设定目标，你的生活将会变得平衡。</p>
<p class="calibre9">As you approach each goal, bear in mind the Magic Duo<em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">— 100% commitment</em> and <em xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre5">I count—</em>to help you focus and achieve a sense of fulfillment.<br class="calibre4"/>当你接近每一个目标的时候，记住魔术二人组——100% 的承诺和我计数——来帮助你集中精力并获得成就感。</p>
<p class="calibre9">You may not be able to cover every area of your grid every day. Naturally, there will be times in your life when one area takes precedence. For example, when on vacation you can forget about other areas of the grid. Just concentrate on having a good time. The Magic Duo will ensure that you take it all in. In the same manner, an important work project may require your undivided attention for a time. What you are ultimately looking for is overall balance.<br class="calibre4"/>你可能不能每天覆盖网格的每个区域。自然地，在你的生活中总会有一些时候，一个区域是最重要的。例如，在度假的时候，你可以忘记网格中的其他区域。只要集中精力享受美好时光。魔术二人组会确保你完全沉浸其中。同样，一个重要的工作项目可能需要你全神贯注一段时间。你最终要寻找的是整体的平衡。</p>
<p class="spaceabove1">Consider this: If you don’t feel like taking the time or making the effort to do these steps, you will be greatly shortchanging yourself. Isn’t your life worth it? What I’m asking you to do is to set up the basic structure of your life, so you can then go on living in a way that supports your growth and satisfaction. As Janet, one of my students, so aptly put it, “If you always do what you’ve always done, you’ll always get what you’ve always got.” This thought certainly served to get her moving!<br class="calibre4"/>考虑到这一点: 如果你不想花时间或努力去做这些步骤，你将大大缩短你自己的时间。难道你的生命不值得吗？我要求你们做的是建立起你们生活的基本结构，这样你们就可以继续以一种支持你们成长和满足的方式生活。正如我的一个学生珍妮特所说: “如果你总是做你一直在做的事情，你总会得到你一直拥有的东西。”这个想法确实让她行动起来了！</p>
<p class="calibre9">If you find it difficult to motivate yourself, don’t put yourself down. Find a self-help group to act as a catalyst. If you can’t find a support group, find what I call a “growth buddy.” You and your buddy can help each other by meeting weekly and working on the grid, your goals, your action plan, or whatever. Committing yourself to do certain homework before each meeting often spurs you on to action. The key is to take your commitment to your buddy seriously and act responsibly during the week by getting everything done that you committed yourself to do.<br class="calibre4"/>如果你发现自己很难激励自己，不要贬低自己。找一个自助小组作为催化剂。如果你找不到一个互助小组，那就找一个我称之为“成长伙伴”的你和你的伙伴可以通过每周见面、制定网格、目标、行动计划或其他方式互相帮助。在每次会面前承诺自己做一些家庭作业往往会激励你行动起来。关键是要认真对待你对朋友的承诺，并在一周内负责任地完成所有你承诺要做的事情。</p>
<p class="calibre9">If you can’t find a self-help group and do not want to work with a growth buddy, find a group conducted by a professional. It is amazing how quickly results materialize when you know what you want and are determined to get it. Most people never take the time to focus on what they want—then they wonder why they always feel empty.<br class="calibre4"/>如果你找不到一个自助小组，也不想和一个成长伙伴一起工作，那就找一个由专业人士指导的小组。当你知道自己想要什么并且下定决心要得到它的时候，你会惊讶地发现结果是如此之快。大多数人从来不花时间专注于他们想要的东西——然后他们想知道为什么他们总是感到空虚。</p>
<p class="calibre9">Keep asking yourself, “How whole is my life?” Continue to create such richness for yourself that nothing can ever take away your basic sense of completeness. Can you imagine how little you would then have to fear?<br class="calibre4"/>不断问自己”我的生活有多完整?”继续为自己创造丰富多彩的生活，没有什么能够剥夺你最基本的完整感。你能想象到那时你会有多么少的恐惧吗？</p>
