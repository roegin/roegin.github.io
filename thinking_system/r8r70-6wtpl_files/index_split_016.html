Generally, they are not properties that can or should be changed. The world is nonlinear. Trying to make it linear for our mathematical or administrative convenience is not usually a good idea even when feasible, and it is rarely feasible. Boundaries are problem-dependent, evanescent, and messy; they are also necessary for organization and clarity. Being less surprised by complex systems is mainly a matter of learning to expect, appreciate, and use the world’s complexity.<br class="calibre2"/>几乎在任何系统中都能发现延迟、非线性、缺乏确定的边界以及系统的其他令我们惊讶的特性。一般来说，它们不是可以或者应该被改变的属性。世界是非线性的。为了我们在数学或行政管理上的便利，试图使它线性化通常不是一个好主意，即使是在可行的情况下，也很少是可行的。边界是依赖于问题的、易逝的和混乱的; 它们对于组织和清晰度也是必要的。对复杂的系统不那么惊讶主要是学会期待、欣赏和使用世界的复杂性。</p><p class="calibre_15">But some systems are more than surprising. They are perverse. These are the systems that are structured in ways that produce truly problematic behavior; they cause us great trouble. There are many forms of systems trouble, some of them unique, but many strikingly common. We call the system structures that produce such common patterns of problematic behavior <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="bold">archetypes</span>. Some of the behaviors these archetypes manifest are addiction, drift to low performance, and escalation. These are so prevalent I had no problem finding in just one week of the <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">International Herald Tribune </span>enough examples to illustrate each of the archetypes described in this chapter. <br class="calibre2"/>但是有些系统更令人惊讶。它们是反常的。这些系统的结构方式会产生真正有问题的行为; 它们给我们带来巨大的麻烦。有许多形式的系统麻烦，其中一些是独特的，但是许多是惊人的常见。我们称之为产生问题行为原型的常见模式的系统结构。这些原型所表现出来的一些行为是成瘾、向低性能漂移和升级。这些是如此普遍，我毫不费力地在《国际先驱论坛报》一周内就找到了足够的例子来说明本章所描述的每一个原型。</p><p class="calibre_15">Understanding archetypal problem-generating structures is not enough. Putting up with them is impossible. They need to be changed. The destruction they cause is often blamed on particular actors or events, although it is actually a consequence of system structure. Blaming, disciplining, firing, twisting policy levers harder, hoping for a more favorable sequence of driving events, tinkering at the margins—these standard responses will not fix structural problems. That is why I call these archetypes “traps.”<br class="calibre2"/>仅仅理解产生问题的原型结构是不够的。忍受它们是不可能的。他们需要改变。它们造成的破坏通常归咎于特定的参与者或事件，尽管它实际上是系统结构的结果。指责、约束、解雇、更加努力地扭曲政策杠杆、希望推动事件发生的顺序更加有利、在边缘修修补补——这些标准回应不会解决结构性问题。这就是为什么我称这些原型为“陷阱”</p><p class="calibre_15">But system traps can be escaped—by recognizing them in advance and not getting caught in them, or by altering the structure—by reformulating goals, by weakening, strengthening, or altering feedback loops, by adding new feedback loops. That is why I call these archetypes not just traps, but opportunities.<br class="calibre2"/>但是，系统陷阱是可以逃脱的——通过提前认识到它们而不被它们所困，或通过改变结构——通过重新制定目标，通过削弱、加强或改变反馈回路，通过添加新的反馈回路。这就是为什么我称这些原型不仅仅是陷阱，而是机会。</p><p class="calibre_22"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Policy Resistance— Fixes that Fail</span></span><br class="calibre2"/>政策阻力ーー修复失败</p><blockquote class="calibre_24">I think the investment tax credit has a good history of being an effective economic stimulus,” said Joseph W.

Balancing loops stabilize systems; behavior patterns persist. This is a great structure if you are trying to maintain your body temperature at 37°C (98.6°F), but some behavior patterns that persist over long periods of time are undesirable. Despite efforts to invent technological or policy “fixes,” the system seems to be intractably stuck, producing the same behavior every year. This is the systemic trap of “fixes that fail” or “policy resistance.” You see this when farm programs try year after year to reduce gluts, but there is still overproduction. There are wars on drugs, after which drugs are as prevalent as ever. There is little evidence that investment tax credits and many other policies designed to stimulate investment when the market is not rewarding investment actually work. No single policy yet has been able to bring down health care costs in the United States. Decades of “job creation” have not managed to keep unemployment permanently low. You probably can name a dozen other areas in which energetic efforts consistently produce non-results.<br class="calibre2"/>正如我们在第二章中看到的，平衡反馈回路结构的主要症状是，尽管外部力量推动系统，但变化不大。平衡循环稳定系统，行为模式持续存在。这是一个伟大的结构，如果你试图保持你的体温在37摄氏度(98.6华氏度) ，但一些行为模式，持续很长时间是不受欢迎的。尽管努力发明技术或政策“解决方案”，这个系统似乎还是难以解决，每年都会产生相同的行为。这就是“修复失败”或“政策阻力”的系统性陷阱当农业计划年复一年地试图减少过剩时，你会看到这一点，但仍然存在生产过剩。在毒品战争之后，毒品仍然像以往一样流行。几乎没有证据表明，投资税收抵免和许多其他旨在刺激投资的政策在市场不回报投资的情况下确实有效。目前还没有一项政策能够降低美国的医疗保健成本。数十年的“创造就业机会”并没有成功地将失业率永久保持在低位。你也许可以列举出十几个其他领域，在这些领域，积极的努力一直没有结果。</p><p class="calibre_15">Policy resistance comes from the bounded rationalities of the actors in a system, each with his or her (or “its” in the case of an institution) own goals. Each actor monitors the state of the system with regard to some important variable—income or prices or housing or drugs or investment—and compares that state with his, her, or its goal. If there is a discrepancy, each actor does something to correct the situation. Usually the greater the discrepancy between the goal and the actual situation, the more emphatic the action will be.<br class="calibre2"/>政策阻力来自于系统中行为者的有限理性，每个行为者都有自己的目标。每个参与者监测系统中某些重要变量的状态——收入、价格、住房、药品或投资——并将这种状态与他的、她的或其目标进行比较。如果存在差异，每个参与者都会采取措施纠正这种情况。通常情况下，目标和实际情况之间的差异越大，行动就越有力。</p><p class="calibre_15">Such resistance to change arises when goals of subsystems are different from and inconsistent with each other. Picture a single-system stock—drug supply on the city streets, for example—with various actors trying to pull that stock in different directions. Addicts want to keep it high, enforcement agencies want to keep it low, pushers want to keep it right in the middle so prices don’t get either too high or too low. The average citizen really just wants to be safe from robberies by addicts trying to get money to buy drugs. All the actors work hard to achieve their different goals.<br class="calibre2"/>当子系统的目标彼此不同或不一致时，就会出现这种对变更的抵制。想象一下一个单一的系统库存——例如，城市街道上的毒品供应——不同的参与者试图将这些库存拉向不同的方向。瘾君子希望保持高价，执法机构希望保持低价，毒品贩子希望保持中等价位，这样价格就不会太高或太低。普通市民真正想要的只是安全，不被那些试图赚钱买毒品的瘾君子抢劫。所有的演员都在努力实现他们不同的目标。</p><p class="calibre_15">If any one actor gains an advantage and moves the system stock (drug supply) in one direction (enforcement agencies manage to cut drug imports at the border), the others double their efforts to pull it back (street prices go up, addicts have to commit more crimes to buy their daily fixes, higher prices bring more profits, suppliers use the profits to buy planes and boats to evade the border patrols). Together, the countermoves produce a standoff, the stock is not much different from before, and that is not what anybody wants.<br class="calibre2"/>如果任何一个行为者获得了优势，将系统库存(毒品供应)转移到一个方向(执法机构设法减少边境的毒品进口) ，其他行为者则加倍努力将其拉回(街头价格上涨，瘾君子不得不犯更多的罪来购买他们的日常毒品，价格上涨带来更多的利润，供应商利用利润购买飞机和船只来逃避边境巡逻)。总之，这些对策造成了僵局，毒品库存和以前没有太大的不同，这不是任何人想要的。</p><p class="calibre_15">In a policy-resistant system with actors pulling in different directions, everyone has to put great effort into keeping the system where no one wants it to be. If any single actor lets up, the others will drag the system closer to their goals, and farther from the goal of the one who let go. In fact, this system structure can operate in a ratchet mode: Intensification of anyone’s effort leads to intensification of everyone else’s. It’s hard to reduce intensification. It takes a lot of mutual trust to say, OK, why don’t we all just back off for a while?<br class="calibre2"/>在一个政策阻力巨大的体系中，每个人都不得不付出巨大的努力来维持这个体系，而没有人希望它成为这样一个体系。如果任何一个参与者松懈了，其他人就会把这个体系拖向他们的目标，而远离那个放手的人的目标。事实上，这种系统结构可以在棘轮模式下运作: 任何人的努力都会导致其他人的努力也会加强。很难减少强化。我们需要相互信任才能说，“好吧，为什么我们不都暂时退一步呢?”？</p><p class="calibre_15">The results of policy resistance can be tragic. In 1967, the Romanian government decided that Romania needed more people and that the way to get them was to make abortions for women under age forty-five illegal. Abortions were abruptly banned. Shortly thereafter, the birth rate tripled. Then the policy resistance of the Romanian people set in.<br class="calibre2"/>政策阻力的结果可能是悲剧性的。1967年，罗马尼亚政府决定罗马尼亚需要更多的人口，而获得这些人口的方法就是使45岁以下的妇女堕胎成为非法。堕胎突然被禁止。此后不久，出生率翻了三倍。然后罗马尼亚人民的政策开始抵制。</p><p class="calibre_15">Although contraceptives and abortions remained illegal, the birth rate slowly came back down nearly to its previous level. This result was achieved primarily though dangerous, illegal abortions, which tripled the maternal mortality rate. In addition, many of the unwanted children that had been born when abortions were illegal were abandoned to orphanages. Romanian families were too poor to raise the many children their government desired decently, and they knew it. So, they resisted the government’s pull toward larger family size, at great cost to themselves and to the generation of children who grew up in orphanages.<br class="calibre2"/>尽管避孕药具和堕胎仍然是非法的，但出生率慢慢地回落到接近以前的水平。这一结果主要是通过危险的非法堕胎实现的，这使得孕产妇死亡率增加了三倍。此外，许多在非法堕胎时出生的不想要的孩子被遗弃在孤儿院。罗马尼亚的家庭太穷，无法抚养政府想要的孩子，他们知道这一点。所以，他们抵制政府对于扩大家庭规模的吸引力，这对他们自己和在孤儿院长大的一代孩子来说都是巨大的代价。</p><p class="calibre_15">One way to deal with policy resistance is to try to overpower it. If you wield enough power and can keep wielding it, the power approach can work, at the cost of monumental resentment and the possibility of explosive consequences if the power is ever let up. This is what happened with the formulator of the Romanian population policy, dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, who tried long and hard to overpower the resistance to his policy. When his government was overturned, he was executed, along with his family. The first law the new government repealed was the ban on abortion and contraception.<br class="calibre2"/>应对政策阻力的方法之一，就是试图压制它。如果你掌握了足够的权力，并且能够继续使用它，那么权力方法可以奏效，代价是巨大的怨恨，以及如果权力被放松，可能产生爆炸性后果的可能性。这就是罗马尼亚人口政策的制定者，独裁者尼古拉 · 齐奥塞斯库的遭遇，他长期以来一直努力克服对他政策的抵制。当他的政府被推翻时，他和他的家人被处决了。新政府废除的第一条法律是禁止堕胎和避孕。</p><p class="calibre_15">The alternative to overpowering policy resistance is so counterintuitive that it’s usually unthinkable. Let go. Give up ineffective policies. Let the resources and energy spent on both enforcing and resisting be used for more constructive purposes. You won’t get your way with the system, but it won’t go as far in a bad direction as you think, because much of the action you were trying to correct was in response to your own action. If you calm down, those who are pulling against you will calm down too. This is what happened in 1933 when Prohibition ended in the United States; the alcohol- driven chaos also largely ended.<br class="calibre2"/>压倒性政策阻力的替代方案是如此违反直觉，以至于通常是不可想象的。放手。放弃无效的政策。让用于执行和抵制的资源和精力用于更具建设性的目的。你不会得到你的方式与系统，但它不会走到一个坏的方向，因为大多数行动，你试图纠正是在回应你自己的行动。如果你冷静下来，那些反对你的人也会冷静下来。这就是1933年禁酒令在美国结束时发生的事情; 酒精驱动的混乱也基本结束了。</p><p class="calibre_15">That calming down may provide the opportunity to look more closely at the feedbacks within the system, to understand the bounded rationality behind them, and to find a way to meet the goals of the participants in the system while moving the state of the system in a better direction.<br class="calibre2"/>冷静下来可以提供一个机会，更仔细地审视系统内的反馈，了解反馈背后的有限理性，并找到一种方法来满足系统参与者的目标，同时使系统状态朝着更好的方向发展。</p><p class="calibre_15">For example, a nation wanting to increase its birth rate might ask why families are having few children and discover that it isn’t because they don’t like children. Perhaps they haven’t the resources, the living space, the time, or the security to have more. Hungary, at the same time Romania was banning abortions, also was worried about its low birth rate—fearing an economic downturn could result from fewer people in the workforce. The Hungarian government discovered that cramped housing was one reason for small family size. The government devised a policy that rewarded larger families with more living space. This policy was only partially successful, because housing was not the only problem. But it was far more successful than Romania’s policy and it avoided Romania’s disastrous results.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7"><small id="filepos265717" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos481767"><span class="calibre8">3</span></a></small></sup><br class="calibre2"/>例如，一个想要提高出生率的国家可能会问为什么家庭很少有孩子，然后发现并不是因为他们不喜欢孩子。也许他们没有资源，没有生活空间，没有时间，也没有安全感去生更多的孩子。匈牙利在罗马尼亚禁止堕胎的同时，也担心其低出生率——担心劳动力减少可能导致经济衰退。匈牙利政府发现，拥挤的住房是家庭规模小的原因之一。政府制定了一项政策，奖励大家庭更多的生活空间。这项政策只取得了部分成功，因为住房并不是唯一的问题。但它远比罗马尼亚的政策成功，避免了罗马尼亚的灾难性后果</p><p class="calibre_15">The most effective way of dealing with policy resistance is to find a way of aligning the various goals of the subsystems, usually by providing an overarching goal that allows all actors to break out of their bounded rationality. If everyone can work harmoniously toward the same outcome (if all feedback loops are serving the same goal), the results can be amazing. The most familiar examples of this harmonization of goals are mobilizations of economies during wartime, or recovery after war or natural disaster.<br class="calibre2"/>处理政策阻力的最有效方法是找到一种方法来调整子系统的各种目标，通常是通过提供一个总体目标，允许所有参与者打破他们的有限理性。如果每个人都能朝着相同的目标和谐地工作(如果所有的反馈回路都服务于相同的目标) ，那么结果可能是惊人的。这种目标协调的最常见的例子是战时的经济动员，或者战后或自然灾害后的恢复。</p><p class="calibre_15">Another example was Sweden’s population policy. During the 1930s, Sweden’s birth rate dropped precipitously, and, like the governments of Romania and Hungary, the Swedish government worried about that. Unlike Romania and Hungary, the Swedish government assessed its goals and those of the population and decided that there was a basis of agreement, not on the size of the family, but on the quality of child care. Every child should be wanted and nurtured. No child should be in material need. Every child should have access to excellent education and health care. These were goals around which the government and the people could align themselves.<br class="calibre2"/>另一个例子是瑞典的人口政策。在20世纪30年代，瑞典的出生率急剧下降，像罗马尼亚和匈牙利政府一样，瑞典政府对此感到担忧。与罗马尼亚和匈牙利不同，瑞典政府评估了自己的目标和人口目标，并决定不是根据家庭规模，而是根据儿童保育的质量达成协议。每个孩子都应该被需要和培养。没有一个孩子需要物质上的帮助。每个孩子都应该有机会接受良好的教育和医疗保健。这些都是政府和人民可以团结起来的目标。</p><p class="calibre_15">The resulting policy looked strange during a time of low birth rate, because it included free contraceptives and abortion—because of the principle that every child should be wanted. The policy also included widespread sex education, easier divorce laws, free obstetrical care, support for families in need, and greatly increased investment in education and health care.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7"><small id="filepos267425" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos482096"><span class="calibre8">4</span></a></small></sup> Since then, the Swedish birth rate has gone up and down several times without causing panic in either direction, because the nation is focused on a far more important goal than the number of Swedes. <br class="calibre2"/>由此产生的政策在低出生率时期看起来很奇怪，因为它包括免费避孕和堕胎——因为每个孩子都应该被要求的原则。这项政策还包括广泛的性教育、更为宽松的离婚法、免费的产科护理、对有需要的家庭的支持，以及大幅增加对教育和医疗保健的投资。4. 自那时以来，瑞典的出生率数次上升和下降，但没有在两个方向引起恐慌，因为国家关注的目标远比瑞典人口的数量重要得多。</p><p class="calibre_15">Harmonization of goals in a system is not always possible, but it’s an worth looking for. It can be found only by letting go of more narrow goals and considering the long term welfare of the entire system.<br class="calibre2"/>在一个系统中协调目标并不总是可能的，但是它是值得寻找的。只有放弃更狭隘的目标，并考虑整个系统的长期福利，才能找到它。</p><blockquote class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">THE TRAP: POLICY RESISTANCE</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_26">When various actors try to pull a system stock toward various goals, the result can be policy resistance. Any new policy, especially if it’s effective, just pulls the stock farther from the goals of other actors and produces additional resistance, with a result that no one likes, but that everyone expends considerable effort in maintaining.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">THE WAY OUT</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_26">Let go.

Hardin used as his opening example a common grazing land:<br class="calibre2"/>生态学家 Garrett Hardin 在1968年的一篇经典文章中描述了公地系统。哈丁用公共牧场作为开篇的例子:</p><blockquote class="calibre_13">Picture a pasture open to all.

And another; and another. . . . But this is the conclusion reached by each and every rational herdsman sharing a commons. Therein is the tragedy.

Ruin is the destination toward which all . . . rush, each pursuing his own best interest.<sup class="calibre7"><small id="filepos270976" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos482464"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre8">6</span><br class="calibre2"/>6</a></small></sup></blockquote><p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre2"/></p><p class="calibre_14">Bounded rationality in a nutshell!<br class="calibre2"/>简而言之就是有限理性！</p><p class="calibre_15">In any commons system there is, first of all, a resource that is commonly shared (the pasture). For the system to be subject to tragedy, the resource must be not only limited, but erodable when overused. That is, beyond some threshold, the less resource there is, the less it is able to regenerate itself, or the more likely it is to be destroyed. As there is less grass on the pasture, the cows eat even the base of the stems from which the new grass grows. The roots no longer hold the soil from washing away in the rains. With less soil, the grass grows more poorly. And so forth. Another reinforcing feedback loop running downhill.<br class="calibre2"/>在任何公共系统中，首先都有一个共享的资源(牧场)。为了使这个系统遭受悲剧，资源不仅必须是有限的，而且在过度使用时是可以被侵蚀的。也就是说，超过某个临界值，资源越少，它自我再生的能力就越小，或者它被破坏的可能性就越大。由于牧场上的草越来越少，牛甚至会吃掉新草生长的茎的根部。根部不再能保持土壤不被雨水冲走。土壤越少，草长得越差。诸如此类。另一个强化的反馈循环正在下滑。</p><p class="calibre_15">A commons system also needs users of the resource (the cows and their owners), which have good reason to increase, and which increase at a rate <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">that is not influenced by the condition of the commons</span>. The individual herdsman has no reason, no incentive, no strong feedback, to let the possibility of overgrazing stop him from adding another cow to the common pasture. To the contrary, he or she has everything to gain. <br class="calibre2"/>公共资源系统还需要资源的用户(奶牛及其所有者) ，这些用户有充分的理由增加，而且增加的速度不受公共资源状况的影响。单个的牧民没有理由，没有动机，没有强烈的反馈，让过度放牧的可能性阻止他把另一头牛添加到公共牧场。相反，他或她可以从中获得一切。</p><p class="calibre_15">The hopeful immigrant to Germany expects nothing but benefit from that country’s generous asylum laws, and has no reason to take into consideration the fact that too many immigrants will inevitably force Germany to toughen those laws. In fact, the knowledge that Germany is discussing that possibility is all the more reason to hurry to Germany!<br class="calibre2"/>希望移民到德国的人只希望从该国慷慨的庇护法中获益，没有理由去考虑这样一个事实: 太多的移民将不可避免地迫使德国加强这些法律。事实上，知道德国正在讨论这种可能性就更有理由赶紧去德国！</p><p class="calibre_15">The tragedy of the commons arises from <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">missing (or too long delayed) feedback </span>from the resource to the growth of the users of that resource. <br class="calibre2"/>公地悲剧是由于缺少(或延迟太久)资源对该资源使用者成长的反馈而引起的。</p><p class="calibre_15">The more users there are, the more resource is used. The more resource is used, the less there is per user. If the users follow the bounded rationality of the commons (“There’s no reason for <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">me </span>to be the one to limit my cows!”), there is no reason for any of them to decrease their use. Eventually, then, the harvest rate will exceed the capacity of the resource to bear the harvest. Because there is no feedback to the user, overharvesting will continue. The resource will decline. Finally, the erosion loop will kick in, the resource will be destroyed, and all the users will be ruined. <br class="calibre2"/>用户越多，使用的资源就越多。使用的资源越多，每个用户拥有的资源就越少。如果用户遵循公共资源的有限理性(“我没有理由限制我的奶牛!”)那么他们中的任何一个都没有理由减少他们的使用。最终，收获率将超过资源承受收获的能力。因为没有反馈给用户，过度收获将会继续。资源将会减少。最后，侵蚀循环将开始，资源将被破坏，所有的用户将被毁灭。</p><p class="calibre_15">Surely, you’d think, no group of people would be so shortsighted as to destroy their commons. But consider just a few commonplace examples of commons that are being driven, or have been driven, to disaster:<br class="calibre2"/>当然，你可能会认为，没有一群人会如此目光短浅，以至于破坏他们的公共资源。但是想想一些普通的例子，公地正在被驱使，或者已经被驱使，走向灾难:</p><p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre2"/></p><blockquote class="calibre_13">• Uncontrolled access to a popular national park can bring in such crowds that the park’s natural beauties are destroyed.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">• It is to everyone’s immediate advantage to go on using fossil fuels, although carbon dioxide from these fuels is a greenhouse gas that is causing global climate change.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">• If every family can have any number of children it wants, but society as a whole has to support the cost of education, health care, and environmental protection for all children, the number of children born can exceed the capacity of the society to support them all.

Tragedy can lurk not only in the use of common resources, but also in the use of common sinks, shared places where pollution can be dumped. A family, company, or nation can reduce its costs, increase its profits, or grow faster if it can get the entire community to absorb or handle its wastes. It reaps a large gain, while itself having to live with only a fraction of its own pollution (or none, if it can dump downstream or downwind). There is no rational reason why a polluter should desist. In these cases, the feedback influencing the rate of use of the common resource—whether it is a source or a sink—is weak.<br class="calibre2"/>这些例子与可再生资源的过度开采有关——你已经在系统动物园中看到了这种结构。悲剧不仅潜伏在公共资源的使用中，也潜伏在公共水池的使用中，公共水池是可以倾倒污染的共享场所。如果一个家庭、公司或国家能够让整个社区吸收或处理它的废物，它就能够降低成本，增加利润，或者发展得更快。它获得了巨大的收益，而它自己却只能忍受自身污染的一小部分(如果它可以向下游或顺风处倾倒的话，甚至一点污染也没有)。没有理性的理由说明为什么污染者应该停止污染。在这些情况下，影响公共资源使用率的反馈——无论是源还是汇——是微弱的。</p><p class="calibre_15">If you think that the reasoning of an exploiter of the commons is hard to understand, ask yourself how willing you are to carpool in order to reduce air pollution, or to clean up after yourself whenever you make a mess.

The second, privatization, makes a direct feedback link from the condition of the resource to those who use it, by making sure that gains and losses fall on the same decision maker. The owner still may abuse the resource, but now it takes ignorance or irrationality to do so. The third solution, regulation, makes an indirect feedback link from the condition of the resource through regulators to users. For this feedback to work, the regulators must have the expertise to monitor and interpret correctly the condition of the commons, they must have effective means of deterrence, and they must have the good of the whole community at heart. (They cannot be uninformed or weak or corrupt.)<br class="calibre2"/>这些解决方案中的第一个，劝告，试图通过道德压力使公地的使用保持在足够低的水平，以免资源受到威胁。第二种是私有化，通过确保利益和损失落在同一个决策者的头上，使资源的状况与使用者之间建立了直接的反馈联系。所有者仍然可能滥用资源，但现在这样做需要无知或非理性。第三种解决方案，监管，通过监管者将资源状况与用户之间的间接反馈联系起来。要使这种反馈发挥作用，监管机构必须具备监测和正确解释公地状况的专门知识，必须拥有有效的威慑手段，必须将整个社会的利益放在心上。(他们不能无知、软弱或腐败</p><p class="calibre_15">Some “primitive” cultures have managed common resources effectively for generations through education and exhortation.

One name for this archetype is “drift to low performance.” Examples include falling market share in a business, eroding quality of service at a hospital, continuously dirtier rivers or air, increased fat in spite of periodic diets, the state of America’s public schools—or my onetime jogging program, which somehow just faded away.<br class="calibre2"/>一些系统不仅抵制政策，处于正常的糟糕状态，而且还在不断恶化。这种原型的一个名称是“向低性能漂移”这方面的例子包括: 企业市场份额下降，医院服务质量下降，河流或空气持续污染，尽管定期节食，但脂肪增加，美国公立学校的状况，或者我曾经的慢跑计划，不知怎么就消失了。</p><p class="calibre_15">The actor in this feedback loop (British government, business, hospital, fat person, school administrator, jogger) has, as usual, a performance goal or desired system state that is compared to the actual state. If there is a discrepancy, action is taken. So far, that is an ordinary balancing feedback loop that should keep performance at the desired level.<br class="calibre2"/>这个反馈回路中的参与者(英国政府、商业、医院、肥胖者、学校管理人员、慢跑者)像往常一样，有一个与实际状态相比较的绩效目标或期望的系统状态。如果存在差异，就采取行动。到目前为止，这是一个普通的平衡反馈回路，应该保持性能在期望的水平。</p><p class="calibre_15">But in this system, there is a distinction between the actual system state and the perceived state. <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">The actor tends to believe bad news more than good news</span>. As actual performance varies, the best results are dismissed as aberrations, the worst results stay in the memory. The actor thinks things are worse than they really are. <br class="calibre2"/>但是在这个系统中，实际的系统状态和感知的状态是有区别的。演员更倾向于相信坏消息而不是好消息。由于实际表演的不同，最好的结果被认为是偏差，最坏的结果留在记忆中。演员认为事情比实际情况更糟糕。</p><p class="calibre_15">And to complete this tragic archetype, <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">the desired state of the system is influenced by the perceived state</span>. Standards aren’t absolute. When perceived performance slips, the goal is allowed to slip. “Well, that’s about all you can expect.” “Well, we’re not doing much worse than we were last year.” “Well, look around, everybody else is having trouble too.” <br class="calibre2"/>为了完成这个悲剧原型，系统的期望状态受到感知状态的影响。标准不是绝对的。当感知表现下滑时，目标就会下滑。这就是你所能期待的。”“嗯，我们并没有比去年糟糕多少。”“看看周围，大家都有麻烦了。”</p><p class="calibre_15">The balancing feedback loop that should keep the system state at an acceptable level is overwhelmed by a reinforcing feedback loop heading downhill. The lower the perceived system state, the lower the desired state. The lower the desired state, the less discrepancy, and the less corrective action is taken. The less corrective action, the lower the system state. If this loop is allowed to run unchecked, it can lead to a continuous degradation in the system’s performance.<br class="calibre2"/>应该保持系统状态在可接受水平的平衡反馈回路被不断下降的强化反馈回路所淹没。感知到的系统状态越低，期望的状态越低。期望状态越低，差异越小，采取的纠正措施越少。纠正行动越少，系统状态越低。如果允许这个循环不加检查地运行，它会导致系统性能的持续下降。</p><p class="calibre_15">Another name for this system trap is “eroding goals.” It is also called the “boiled frog syndrome,” from the old story (I don’t know whether it is true) that a frog put suddenly in hot water will jump right out, but if it is put into cold water that is gradually heated up, the frog will stay there happily until it boils. “Seems to be getting a little warm in here. Well, but then it’s not so much warmer than it was a while ago.” Drift to low performance is a gradual process. If the system state plunged quickly, there would be an agitated corrective process. But if it drifts down slowly enough to erase the memory of (or belief in) how much better things used to be, everyone is lulled into lower and lower expectations, lower effort, lower performance.<br class="calibre2"/>这个系统陷阱的另一个名字是“侵蚀目标”它也被称为“煮青蛙综合症”，来自一个古老的故事(我不知道是否正确) ，一只青蛙突然放在热水中会跳出来，但如果它被放在冷水中逐渐加热，青蛙会高兴地呆在那里，直到它沸腾。看起来这里有点热了。好吧，但是现在也没有刚才那么暖和了。”漂移到低性能是一个渐进的过程。如果系统状态迅速下降，就会有一个激烈的纠正过程。但是，如果它慢慢下降，足以抹去记忆(或相信)多少更好的东西曾经是，每个人都被哄骗到越来越低的期望，更低的努力，更低的表现。</p><p class="calibre_15">There are two antidotes to eroding goals. One is to keep standards absolute, regardless of performance. Another is to make goals sensitive to the <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">best </span>performances of the past, instead of the worst. If perceived performance has an upbeat bias instead of a downbeat one, if one takes the best results as a standard, and the worst results only as a temporary setback, then the same system structure can pull the system up to better and better performance. The reinforcing loop going downward, which said “the worse things get, the worse I’m going to let them get,” becomes a reinforcing loop going upward: “The better things get, the harder I’m going to work to make them even better.” <br class="calibre2"/>有两种方法可以解决目标被削弱的问题。一个是保持绝对的标准，不管业绩如何。另一个是让目标敏感于过去最好的表现，而不是最差的表现。如果感知到的绩效有一个乐观的偏见而不是悲观的，如果一个人把最好的结果作为一个标准，而最坏的结果只是一个暂时的挫折，那么同样的系统结构可以把系统拉到更好和更好的绩效。向下的强化循环说“事情变得越糟糕，我就会让它变得越糟糕”，变成了向上的强化循环: “事情变得越好，我就越努力让它变得更好。”</p><p class="calibre_15">If I had applied that lesson to my jogging, I’d be running marathons by now.<br class="calibre2"/>如果我把这个教训用在慢跑上，我现在就已经跑马拉松了。</p><blockquote class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">THE TRAP: DRIFT TO LOW PERFORMANCE</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_26">Allowing performance standards to be influenced by past performance, especially if there is a negative bias in perceiving past performance, sets up a reinforcing feedback loop of eroding goals that sets a system drifting toward low performance.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">THE WAY OUT</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_26">Keep performance standards absolute.

Escalation comes from a reinforcing loop set up by competing actors trying to get ahead of each other. The goal of one part of the system or one actor is not absolute, like the temperature of a room thermostat being set at 18°C (65°F), but is related to the state of another part of the system, another actor. Like many of the other system traps, escalation is not necessarily a bad thing. If the competition is about some desirable goal, like a more efficient computer or a cure for AIDS, it can hasten the whole system toward the goal. But when it is escalating hostility, weaponry, noise, or irritation, this is an insidious trap indeed. The most common and awful examples are arms races and those places on earth where implacable enemies live constantly on the edge of self-reinforcing violence.<br class="calibre2"/>“我给你加一个”是导致事态升级的决策规则。升级来自于一个强化的循环，这个循环是由相互竞争的参与者设置的，他们试图抢在对方前面。系统的一个部分或一个参与者的目标不是绝对的，就像室内恒温器的温度设定在18摄氏度(65华氏度) ，而是与系统的另一个参与者的状态有关。像许多其他的系统陷阱一样，升级不一定是件坏事。如果竞争是为了某个理想的目标，比如更高效的计算机或者治愈艾滋病的方法，它可以加速整个系统朝着这个目标前进。但是，当敌意、武器、噪音或愤怒不断升级时，这确实是一个阴险的陷阱。最常见和最可怕的例子是军备竞赛和地球上那些顽固的敌人不断生活在自我强化的暴力边缘的地方。</p><p class="calibre_15">Each actor takes its desired state from the other’s perceived system state—and ups it! Escalation is not just keeping up with the Joneses, but keeping slightly ahead of the Joneses. The United States and the Soviet Union for years exaggerated their reports of each other’s armaments in order to justify more armaments of their own. Each weapons increase on one side caused a scramble to surpass it on the other side. Although each side blamed the other for the escalation, it would be more systematic to say that each side was escalating itself—its own weapons development started a process that was sure to require still more weapons development in the future. This system caused trillions of dollars of expense, the degradation of the economies of two superpowers, and the evolution of unimaginably destructive weapons, which still threaten the world.<br class="calibre2"/>每个参与者都从对方感知到的系统状态中获取自己想要的状态——并将其提升！间谍大邻演不仅要跟上邻居的步伐，还要略微领先于邻居。多年来，美国和苏联夸大了他们对彼此军备的报告，以证明他们拥有更多的军备是合理的。每一次武器的增加都会导致一方争相超越另一方。虽然双方都指责对方造成了事态升级，但更系统的说法是，双方都在升级自己的武器——它自己的武器发展开始了一个进程，今后肯定还需要更多的武器发展。这一体系造成了数万亿美元的开支，两个超级大国的经济恶化，以及难以想象的破坏性武器的演变，这些武器仍然威胁着世界。</p><p class="calibre_15">Negative campaigning is another perverse example of escalation. One candidate smears another, so the other smears back, and so forth, until the voters have no idea that their candidates have any positive features, and the whole democratic process is demeaned.<br class="calibre2"/>负面竞选活动是另一个反常的升级例子。一个候选人抹黑另一个候选人，另一个候选人抹黑另一个候选人，以此类推，直到选民不知道他们的候选人有任何积极的特点，整个民主进程被贬低。</p><p class="calibre_15">Then there are price wars, with one economic competitor underpricing another, which causes the other to cut prices more, which causes the first to cut prices yet again, until both sides are losing money, but neither side can easily back out.

One company does something bright and loud and arresting. Its competitor does something louder, bigger, brasher. The first company outdoes that.

All players start out equal. The ones who manage to be first at building “hotels” on their property are able to extract “rent” from the other players—which they can then use to buy more hotels.

Because the two species are different, one will necessarily reproduce faster, or be able to use the resource more efficiently than the other. It will win a larger share of the resource, which will give it the ability to multiply more and keep winning. It will not only dominate the niche, it will drive the losing competitor to extinction. That will happen not by direct confrontation usually, but by appropriating all the resource, leaving none for the weaker competitor.<br class="calibre2"/>成功到成功在生态学领域是一个著名的概念，在那里它被称为“竞争排除原则”这个原则认为，两个不同的物种不可能生活在完全相同的生态位中，为了完全相同的资源而竞争。因为两个物种是不同的，其中一个必然会繁殖得更快，或者能够比另一个更有效地利用资源。它们将赢得更大的资源份额，这将使它们有能力繁殖更多，并继续获胜。它不仅会主宰利基市场，还会将失败的竞争对手赶尽杀绝。这通常不是通过直接对抗，而是通过占用所有的资源，不给弱者留下任何东西。</p><p class="calibre_15">Another expression of this trap was part of the critique of capitalism by Karl Marx. Two firms competing in the same market will exhibit the same behavior as two species competing in a niche. One will gain a slight advantage, through greater efficiency or smarter investment or better technology or bigger bribes, or whatever. With that advantage, the firm will have more income to invest in productive facilities or newer technologies or advertising or bribes. Its reinforcing feedback loop of capital accumulation will be able to turn faster than that of the other firm, enabling it to produce still more and earn still more. If there is a finite market and no antitrust law to stop it, one firm will take over everything as long as it chooses to reinvest in and expand its production facilities.<br class="calibre2"/>这种陷阱的另一种表现形式是卡尔 · 马克思对资本主义的批判。两个公司在同一个市场上竞争，会表现出与两个物种在同一个利基市场上竞争相同的行为。其中一个会通过更高的效率、更聪明的投资、更好的技术、更多的贿赂或者其他方式获得微弱的优势。有了这些优势，公司就会有更多的收入来投资于生产设施、更新的技术、广告或贿赂。它强化的资本积累反馈回路将能够比其他公司转得更快，使它能够生产更多，赚得更多。如果有一个有限的市场，没有反垄断法来阻止它，一个公司将接管一切，只要它选择再投资和扩大其生产设施。</p><p class="calibre_15">Some people think the fall of the communist Soviet Union has disproved the theories of Karl Marx, but this particular analysis of his—that market competition systematically eliminates market competition—is demonstrated wherever there is, or used to be, a competitive market. Because of the reinforcing feedback loop of success to the successful, the many automobile companies in the United States were reduced to three (not one, because of antitrust laws). In most major U.S. cities, there is only one newspaper left. In every market economy, we see long term trends of declining numbers of farms, while the size of farms increases.<br class="calibre2"/>有些人认为，共产主义苏联的垮台推翻了马克思的理论，但他对市场竞争系统性地消除市场竞争的这一特殊分析，证明了无论何处存在或曾经存在竞争性市场。由于成功者与成功者之间不断加强的反馈循环，美国的许多汽车公司被减少到三家(不是一家，因为反垄断法)。在美国大多数主要城市，只剩下一家报纸。在每一个市场经济体中，我们都看到农场数量下降的长期趋势，而农场规模却在增加。</p><p class="calibre_15">The trap of success to the successful does its greatest damage in the many ways it works to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.

Rule beating means evasive action to get around the intent of a system’s rules—abiding by the letter, but not the spirit, of the law. Rule beating becomes a problem only when it leads a system into large distortions, unnatural behaviors that would make no sense at all in the absence of the rules. If it gets out of hand, rule beating can cause systems to produce very damaging behavior indeed.<br class="calibre2"/>哪里有规则，哪里就有可能打破规则。规则打击意味着规避系统规则的意图——遵守法律的字面意思，而不是精神意思。规则打击只有在它导致系统出现大规模扭曲、不自然的行为时才会成为问题，而这些行为在没有规则的情况下是毫无意义的。如果它失去控制，规则打击会导致系统产生非常有害的行为。</p><p class="calibre_15">Rule beating that distorts nature, the economy, organizations, and the human spirit can be destructive. Here are some examples, some serious, some less so, of rule beating:<br class="calibre2"/>规则打击扭曲了自然，经济，组织和人类精神，可以是破坏性的。下面是一些打破规则的例子，有些很严重，有些不那么严重:</p><p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre2"/></p><blockquote class="calibre_13">• Departments of governments, universities, and corporations often engage in pointless spending at the end of the fiscal year just to get rid of money—because if they don’t spend their budget this year, they will be allocated less next year.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">• In the 1970s, the state of Vermont adopted a land-use law called Act 250 that requires a complex approval process for subdivisions that create lots of ten acres or less. Now Vermont has an extraordinary number of lots just a little over ten acres.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">• To reduce grain imports and assist local grain farmers, European countries imposed import restrictions on feed grains in the 1960s. No one thought, while the restrictions were being drafted, about the starchy root called cassava, which also happens to be a good animal feed. Cassava was not included in the restrictions. So corn imports from North America were replaced by cassava imports from Asia.<sup class="calibre7"><small id="filepos321054" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos483936"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre8">14</span><br class="calibre2"/>14</a></small></sup></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">• The U.S. Endangered Species Act restricts development wherever an endangered species has its habitat.

Drivers obey the speed limits, when they’re in the vicinity of a police car. Feed grains are no longer imported into Europe. Development does not proceed where an endangered species is documented as present. The “letter of the law” is met, the spirit of the law is not. That is a warning about needing to design the law with the whole system, including its self-organizing evasive possibilities, in mind. <br class="calibre2"/>注意，规则打击会产生所遵循的规则的外观。当司机在警车附近时，他们遵守速度限制。饲料谷物不再进口到欧洲。在濒危物种被记录在案的情况下，发展不会继续。“法律条文”得到满足，而法律精神却没有得到满足。这是一个警告，需要在设计法律时考虑到整个系统，包括其自组织的规避可能性。</p><p class="calibre_15">Rule beating is usually a response of the lower levels in a hierarchy to overrigid, deleterious, unworkable, or ill-defined rules from above. There are two generic responses to rule beating. One is to try to stamp out the self-organizing response by strengthening the rules or their enforcement—usually giving rise to still greater system distortion. That’s the way further into the trap.<br class="calibre2"/>规则打击通常是层次结构中较低级别对来自上层的过于僵化、有害、不可操作或定义不清的规则的反应。对于规则打击有两种通用的反应。一种是试图通过加强规则或强制执行来消除自组织反应——通常会导致更大的系统扭曲。这就是进一步深入陷阱的方法。</p><p class="calibre_15">The way out of the trap, the opportunity, is to understand rule beating as useful feedback, and to revise, improve, rescind, or better explain the rules.

That’s because the goal is the direction-setter of the system, the definer of discrepancies that require action, the indicator of compliance, failure, or success toward which balancing feedback loops work. If the goal is defined badly, if it doesn’t measure what it’s supposed to measure, if it doesn’t reflect the real welfare of the system, then the system can’t possibly produce a desirable result. Systems, like the three wishes in the traditional fairy tale, have a terrible tendency to produce exactly and only what you ask them to produce. Be careful what you ask them to produce.<br class="calibre2"/>回到第一章，我说过影响一个系统行为的最有力的方法之一就是通过它的目的或者目标。这是因为目标是系统的方向设定者，需要采取行动的差异的定义者，遵从性、失败或平衡反馈循环工作的成功的指示器。如果目标定义不当，如果它不能度量它应该度量的东西，如果它不能反映系统的真实福利，那么系统就不可能产生理想的结果。系统，就像传统童话中的三个愿望一样，有一个可怕的倾向，就是只生产你要求它们生产的东西。小心你让他们生产的东西。</p><p class="calibre_15">If the desired system state is national security, and that is defined as the amount of money spent on the military, the system will produce military spending. It may or may not produce national security. In fact, security may be undermined if the spending drains investment from other parts of the economy, and if the spending goes for exorbitant, unnecessary, or unworkable weapons.<br class="calibre2"/>如果期望的系统状态是国家安全，而国家安全被定义为花在军事上的钱数，那么系统将产生军事开支。它可能会也可能不会产生国家安全。事实上，如果开支耗尽了经济其他领域的投资，如果开支用于过高的、不必要的或不可行的武器，安全可能会受到破坏。</p><p class="calibre_15">If the desired system state is good education, measuring that goal by the amount of money spent per student will ensure money spent per student. If the quality of education is measured by performance on standardized tests, the system will produce performance on standardized tests. Whether either of these measures is correlated with good education is at least worth thinking about.<br class="calibre2"/>如果理想的系统状态是良好的教育，用每个学生花费的金额来衡量这个目标将确保每个学生花费的金额。如果教育质量是通过标准化考试的成绩来衡量的，那么这个系统就会产生标准化考试的成绩。至少值得思考的是，这些指标中的任何一项是否与良好的教育相关。</p><p class="calibre_15">In the early days of family planning in India, program goals were defined in terms of the number of IUDs implanted. So doctors, in their eagerness to meet their targets, put loops into women without patient approval.<br class="calibre2"/>在印度计划生育的早期，计划目标是根据植入宫内节育器的数量来定义的。因此，医生们急于达到他们的目标，在没有得到病人同意的情况下给妇女植入了环。</p><p class="calibre_15">These examples confuse effort with result, one of the most common mistakes in designing systems around the wrong goal. Maybe the worst mistake of this kind has been the adoption of the GNP as the measure of national economic success. The GNP is the gross national product, the money value of the final goods and services produced by the economy. As a measure of human welfare, it has been criticized almost from the moment it was invented:<br class="calibre2"/>这些例子混淆了努力和结果，这是围绕错误目标设计系统时最常见的错误之一。也许这类错误中最严重的就是将国民生产总值作为衡量国家经济成功的标准。国民生产总值是国民生产总值，是经济生产的最终产品和服务的货币价值。作为衡量人类福利的标准，它几乎从一开始就受到了批评:</p><blockquote class="calibre_13">The gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials.

(If there are more car accidents and medical bills and repair bills, the GNP goes up.) It counts only marketed goods and services. (If all parents hired people to bring up their children, the GNP would go up.) It does not reflect distributional equity. (An expensive second home for a rich family makes the GNP go up more than an inexpensive basic home for a poor family.) It measures effort rather than achievement, gross production and consumption rather than efficiency. New light bulbs that give the same light with one-eighth the electricity and that last ten times as long make the GNP go down.<br class="calibre2"/>国民生产总值把商品和坏东西混为一谈。(如果发生更多的车祸，医疗费用和维修费用，国民生产总值会上升它只计算市场上的商品和服务。(如果所有的父母都雇人抚养他们的孩子，国民生产总值就会上升它没有反映出分配公平。(一个富裕家庭拥有一套昂贵的第二套住房比一个贫穷家庭拥有一套便宜的基本住房的价格更高)它衡量的是努力而不是成就，衡量的是总生产和消费而不是效率。新的灯泡发出同样的光，只有八分之一的电力，而且持续时间是 GNP 的十倍，这使得 GNP 下降。</p><p class="calibre_15">GNP is a measure of <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">throughput</span>—flows of stuff made and purchased in a year—rather than capital stocks, the houses and cars and computers and stereos that are the source of real wealth and real pleasure. It could be argued that the best society would be one in which capital stocks can be and used with the lowest possible throughput, rather than the highest. <br class="calibre2"/>国民生产总值(GNP)是衡量生产能力的指标——一年内生产和购买的商品的流量——而不是资本存量、房屋、汽车、电脑和音响，后者是真正的财富和真正的乐趣的来源。可以说，最好的社会应该是资本存量可以用尽可能低的产量来使用，而不是用尽可能高的产量。</p><p class="calibre_15">Although there is every reason to want a thriving economy, there is no particular reason to want the GNP to go up. But governments around the world respond to a signal of faltering GNP by taking numerous actions to keep it growing. Many of those actions are simply wasteful, stimulating inefficient production of things no one particularly wants. Some of them, such as overharvesting forests in order to stimulate the economy in the short term, threaten the long term good of the economy or the society or the environment.<br class="calibre2"/>尽管有充分的理由希望经济繁荣，但没有特别的理由希望国民生产总值上升。但是世界各国政府对国民生产总值下降的信号作出反应，采取了许多行动来保持增长。许多这样的行动只是简单的浪费，刺激了没有人特别想要的东西的低效率生产。其中一些措施，例如为了在短期内刺激经济而过度砍伐森林，威胁到经济、社会或环境的长期利益。</p><p class="calibre_15">If you define the goal of a society as GNP, that society will do its best to produce GNP. It will not produce welfare, equity, justice, or efficiency unless you define a goal and regularly measure and report the state of welfare, equity, justice, or efficiency. The world would be a different place if instead of competing to have the highest per capita GNP, nations competed to have the highest per capita stocks of wealth with the lowest throughput, or the lowest infant mortality, or the greatest political freedom, or the cleanest environment, or the smallest gap between the rich and the poor.<br class="calibre2"/>如果你把一个社会的目标定义为国民生产总值，那么这个社会将尽最大努力来生产国民生产总值。它不会产生福利、公平、正义或效率，除非你定义一个目标，并定期测量和报告福利、公平、正义或效率的状态。如果各国不是竞相争取最高的人均国民生产总值，而是竞相争取最高的人均财富储备、最低的生产量、最低的婴儿死亡率、最大的政治自由、最干净的环境或最小的贫富差距，那么世界将会是一个不同的地方。</p><p class="calibre_15">Seeking the wrong goal, satisfying the wrong indicator, is a system characteristic almost opposite from rule beating. In rule beating, the system is out to evade an unpopular or badly designed rule, while giving the appearance of obeying it. In seeking the wrong goal, the system obediently follows the rule and produces its specified result—which is not necessarily what anyone actually wants. You have the problem of wrong goals when you find something stupid happening “because it’s the rule.” You have the problem of rule beating when you find something stupid happening because it’s the way around the rule. Both of these system perversions can be going on at the same time with regard to the same rule.<br class="calibre2"/>追求错误的目标，满足错误的指标，是一个与规则打击几乎相反的系统特征。在规则打击中，系统是为了逃避一个不受欢迎或设计糟糕的规则，同时给人一种遵守规则的假象。在追求错误的目标时，系统会顺从地遵循规则并产生特定的结果——这并不一定是任何人真正想要的。当你发现一些愚蠢的事情正在发生时，你就有了错误目标的问题，“因为这是规则。”当你发现一些愚蠢的事情正在发生时，你会有打破规则的问题，因为这是绕过规则的方式。对于同一条规则，这两种系统扭曲可能同时发生。</p><blockquote class="calibre_25"><span class="calibre3"><span class="bold">THE TRAP: SEEKING THE WRONG GOAL</span></span></blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_26">System behavior is particularly sensitive to the goals of feedback loops.

So rules evolved, that defined various classes of boat by length and sail area and other parameters, and that restricted races to competitors of the same class.<br class="calibre2"/>人们很快发现，如果参赛者在速度和机动性方面大致相当，那么比赛就会更有趣。因此，规则不断发展，通过长度、航行面积和其他参数来定义不同类别的船，并将比赛局限于同一类别的竞争者。</p><p class="calibre_15">Soon boats were being designed not for normal sailing, but for winning races within the categories defined by the rules. They squeezed the last possible burst of speed out of a square inch of sail, or the lightest possible load out of a standard-sized rudder. These boats were strange-looking and strange-handling, not at all the sort of boat you would want to take out fishing or for a Sunday sail. As the races became more serious, the rules became stricter and the boat designs more bizarre.<br class="calibre2"/>很快，船只不再是为普通航行而设计的，而是为了在规则定义的范围内赢得比赛。他们从一平方英寸的帆中挤出最后一次可能的速度爆发，或者从标准尺寸的舵中挤出最轻的可能载荷。这些船看起来很奇怪，操纵起来也很奇怪，一点也不像那种你会想出去钓鱼或者周日航行的船。随着比赛变得越来越严肃，规则变得越来越严格，船只的设计也越来越奇怪。</p><p class="calibre_15">Now racing sailboats are extremely fast, highly responsive, and nearly unseaworthy. They need athletic and expert crews to manage them. No one would think of using an America’s Cup yacht for any purpose other than racing within the rules. The boats are so optimized around the present rules that they have lost all resilience. Any change in the rules would render them useless.<br class="calibre2"/>现在赛艇速度极快，反应迅速，几乎不适合航海。它们需要运动员和专家来管理它们。没有人会想到使用美洲杯游艇的任何目的，除了在规则范围内比赛。这些游艇在现行规则下进行了优化，以至于失去了所有的弹性。规则的任何改变都会让它们变得毫无用处。</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_16"></div>
