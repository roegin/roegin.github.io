They continue to surprise me, although I have been teaching them for years. That you and I are surprised says as much about us as it does about dynamic systems. The interactions between what I think I know about dynamic systems and my experience of the real world never fails to be humbling. They keep reminding me of three truths:<br class="calibre2"/>动物园里简单的系统可能会让你对它们的行为感到困惑。尽管我已经教它们很多年了，但它们仍然让我感到惊讶。你和我的惊讶不仅说明了动态系统，也说明了我们自己。我认为我对动态系统的了解和我对现实世界的体验之间的相互作用总是令人感到谦卑。它们不断提醒我三个真理:</p><p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre2"/></p><blockquote class="calibre_13">1. Everything we think we know about the world is a model. Every word and every language is a model. All maps and statistics, books and databases, equations and computer programs are models. So are the ways I picture the world in my head—my <span class="italic">mental </span>models. None of these is or ever will be the <span class="italic">real </span>world. </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">2. Our models usually have a strong congruence with the world. That is why we are such a successful species in the biosphere. Especially complex and sophisticated are the mental models we develop from direct, intimate experience of nature, people, and organizations immediately around us.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">3. However, and conversely, our models fall far short of representing the world fully. That is why we make mistakes and why we are regularly surprised. In our heads, we can keep track of only a few variables at one time. We often draw illogical conclusions from accurate assumptions, or logical conclusions from inaccurate assumptions. Most of us, for instance, are surprised by the amount of growth an exponential process can generate. Few of us can intuit how to damp oscillations in a complex system.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">In short, this book is poised on a duality. We know a tremendous amount about how the world works, but not nearly enough. Our knowledge is amazing; our ignorance even more so. We can improve our understanding, but we can’t make it perfect. I believe both sides of this duality, because I have learned much from the study of systems.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="bold">Everything we think we know about the world is a model. </span>Our models do have a strong congruence with the world. Our models fall far short of representing the real world fully. </blockquote><p class="calibre_15">This chapter describes some of the reasons why dynamic systems are so often surprising. Alternately, it is a compilation of some of the ways our mental models fail to take into account the complications of the real world—at least those ways that one can see from a systems perspective. It is a warning list. Here is where hidden snags lie. You can’t navigate well in an interconnected, feedback-dominated world unless you take your eyes off short-term events and look for long term behavior and structure; unless you are aware of false boundaries and bounded rationality; unless you take into account limiting factors, nonlinearities and delays. You are likely to mistreat, misdesign, or misread systems if you don’t respect their properties of resilience, self-organization, and hierarchy.<br class="calibre2"/>这一章描述了动态系统经常令人惊讶的一些原因。或者，它是我们的心理模型未能考虑到现实世界的复杂性的一些方式的汇编——至少是那些我们可以从系统的角度看到的方式。这是一个警告列表。这里是隐藏的障碍所在。在一个相互关联、反馈主导的世界里，除非你不再关注短期事件，而是寻找长期行为和结构; 除非你意识到错误的边界和有限理性; 除非你考虑到限制因素、非线性和延迟，否则你无法很好地驾驭这个世界。如果您不尊重系统的弹性、自我组织和层次结构的特性，那么您很可能会误解、错误设计或误读系统。</p><p class="calibre_15">The bad news, or the good news, depending on your need to control the world and your willingness to be delighted by its surprises, is that even if you do understand all these system characteristics, you may be surprised less often, but you will still be surprised.<br class="calibre2"/>坏消息，或者好消息，取决于你控制世界的需要以及你是否愿意为它的惊喜而高兴，即使你理解了所有这些系统特性，你可能不会经常感到惊讶，但你仍然会感到惊讶。</p><p class="calibre_22"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Beguiling Events</span></span><br class="calibre2"/>诱人的事件</p><blockquote class="calibre_24">A system is a big black box </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">Of which we can’t unlock the locks, </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">And all we can find out about </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">Is what goes in and what comes out.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">Related by parameters, </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">Permits us, sometimes, to relate </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">An input, output and a state.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">If this relation’s good and stable </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">Then to predict we may be able, </blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">But if this fails us—heaven forbid!</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">We’ll be compelled to force the lid!</blockquote><p class="calibre_17">—Kenneth Boulding,<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7"><small id="filepos197841" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos477999"><span class="calibre8">2</span></a></small></sup> economist <br class="calibre2"/>ー kenneth Boulding，2位经济学家</p><p class="calibre_14">Systems fool us by presenting themselves—or we fool ourselves by seeing the world—as a series of events. The daily news tells of elections, battles, political agreements, disasters, stock market booms or busts. Much of our ordinary conversation is about specific happenings at specific times and places. A team wins. A river floods. The Dow Jones Industrial Average hits 10,000. Oil is discovered. A forest is cut. Events are the outputs, moment by moment, from the black box of the system.<br class="calibre2"/>系统通过把它们自己呈现给我们来愚弄我们，或者我们通过把世界看作一系列事件来愚弄我们自己。每天的新闻都在讲述选举、战争、政治协议、灾难、股市的繁荣或萧条。我们大部分的日常对话都是关于特定时间和地点发生的特定事件。一个团队获胜。河水泛滥。道琼斯工业平均指数达到10000点。石油被发现。森林被砍伐。事件是系统黑匣子中的输出，每时每刻。</p><p class="calibre_15">Events can be spectacular: crashes, assassinations, great victories, terrible tragedies. They hook our emotions. Although we’ve seen many thousands of them on our TV screens or the front page of the paper, each one is different enough from the last to keep us fascinated (just as we never lose our fascination with the chaotic twists and turns of the weather). It’s endlessly engrossing to take in the world as a series of events, and constantly surprising, because that way of seeing the world has almost no predictive or explanatory value. Like the tip of an iceberg rising above the water, events are the most visible aspect of a larger complex—but not always the most important.<br class="calibre2"/>事件可以是壮观的: 崩溃，暗杀，伟大的胜利，可怕的悲剧。它们勾住了我们的情感。尽管我们在电视屏幕上或报纸的头版上看到过成千上万张照片，但每一张都与上一张截然不同，足以让我们为之着迷(就像我们从未失去对混乱的天气的迷恋一样)。把世界当作一系列事件来看是无穷无尽的引人入胜，而且不断地令人惊讶，因为这种看待世界的方式几乎没有任何预测或解释价值。就像浮出水面的冰山一样，事件是一个更大的复杂事件中最显而易见的一面——但并不总是最重要的。</p><p class="calibre_15">We are less likely to be surprised if we can see how events accumulate into dynamic patterns of <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">behavior</span>. The team is on a winning streak. The variance of the river is increasing, with higher floodwaters during rains and lower flows during droughts. The Dow has been trending up for two years. Discoveries of oil are becoming less frequent. The felling of forests is happening at an ever-increasing rate. <br class="calibre2"/>如果我们能看到事件如何积累成动态的行为模式，我们就不太可能感到惊讶。这个团队正在连胜。河流的变化越来越大，降雨时洪水越来越多，干旱时洪水越来越少。道琼斯工业平均指数两年来一直呈上升趋势。石油的发现越来越少。森林的砍伐正在以越来越快的速度发生。</p><p class="calibre_15">The behavior of a system is its performance over time—its growth, stagnation, decline, oscillation, randomness, or evolution. If the news did a better job of putting events into historical context, we would have better behavior-level understanding, which is deeper than event-level under standing. When a systems thinker encounters a problem, the first thing he or she does is look for data, time graphs, the history of the system. That’s because long term behavior provides clues to the underlying system structure. And structure is the key to understanding not just <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">what </span>is happening, but <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">why</span>. <br class="calibre2"/>一个系统的行为是它随着时间的推移而表现出来的——它的增长、停滞、衰退、振荡、随机或进化。如果新闻能更好地将事件置于历史背景下，我们就能更好地理解行为层面，这比对事件层面的理解要深刻得多。当一个系统思考者遇到一个问题，他或她做的第一件事就是寻找数据，时间图表，系统的历史。这是因为长期的行为为潜在的系统结构提供了线索。结构不仅是理解发生了什么的关键，也是理解发生原因的关键。</p><p class="calibre_15">The structure of a system is its interlocking stocks, flows, and feedback loops. The diagrams with boxes and arrows (my students call them “spaghetti-and-meatball diagrams”) are pictures of system structure. Structure determines what behaviors are latent in the system. A goal-seeking balancing feedback loop approaches or holds a dynamic equilibrium. A reinforcing feedback loop generates exponential growth. The two of them linked together are capable of growth, decay, or equilibrium. If they also contain delays, they may produce oscillations. If they work in periodic, rapid bursts, they may produce even more surprising behaviors.<br class="calibre2"/>一个系统的结构是它的连锁股票，流，和反馈回路。带有方框和箭头的图表(我的学生称之为“意大利面和肉丸图表”)是系统结构的图片。结构决定了系统中潜在的行为。一个寻求目标的平衡反馈回路接近或保持一个动态平衡。一个强化的反馈回路产生指数增长。这两者联系在一起，就能够实现增长、衰退或平衡。如果它们也包含延迟，它们可能会产生振荡。如果它们在周期性的快速爆发中工作，它们可能会产生更令人惊讶的行为。</p><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="bold">System structure is the source of system behavior. </span>
<span class="bold">System behavior reveals itself as a series of events over time.</span></blockquote><p class="calibre_15">Systems thinking goes back and forth constantly between structure (diagrams of stocks, flows, and feedback) and behavior (time graphs). Systems thinkers strive to understand the connections between the hand releasing the Slinky (event) and the resulting oscillations (behavior) and the mechanical characteristics of the Slinky’s helical coil (structure).<br class="calibre2"/>系统思维在结构(股票图、流量图和反馈图)和行为(时间图)之间不断来回。系统思考者努力理解释放出 Slinky 的手(事件)和由此产生的振荡(行为)之间的联系，以及 Slinky 螺旋线圈(结构)的机械特性。</p><p class="calibre_15">Simple examples like a Slinky make this event-behavior-structure distinction seem obvious. In fact, much analysis in the world goes no deeper than events. Listen to every night’s explanation of why the stock market did what it did. Stocks went up (down) because the U.S. dollar fell (rose), or the prime interest rate rose (fell), or the Democrats won (lost), or one country invaded another (or didn’t). Event-event analysis.<br class="calibre2"/>像 Slinky 这样的简单示例使这种事件-行为-结构的区别显而易见。事实上，世界上很多分析并不比事件更深入。听听每天晚上股票市场为什么会这样的解释。股市上涨(下跌)是因为美元下跌(上涨) ，或者主要利率上升(下降) ，或者民主党赢了(输了) ，或者一个国家侵略了另一个国家(或者没有侵略)。事件-事件分析。</p><p class="calibre_15">These explanations give you no ability to predict what will happen tomorrow. They give you no ability to change the behavior of the system—to make the stock market less volatile or a more reliable indicator of the health of corporations or a better vehicle to encourage investment, for instance.<br class="calibre2"/>这些解释让你无法预测明天会发生什么。它们不会让你有能力改变系统的行为——例如，降低股票市场的波动性，或者让股票市场成为反映企业健康状况的更可靠指标，或者成为鼓励投资的更好工具。</p><p class="calibre_15">Most economic analysis goes one level deeper, to behavior over time. Econometric models strive to find the statistical links among past trends in income, savings, investment, government spending, interest rates, output, or whatever, often in complicated equations.<br class="calibre2"/>大多数经济学分析都深入到一个层次，即随着时间的推移而产生的行为。计量经济学模型努力寻找过去收入、储蓄、投资、政府支出、利率、产出等趋势之间的统计联系，通常是在复杂的方程式中。</p><p class="calibre_15">These behavior-based models are more useful than event-based ones, but they still have fundamental problems. First, they typically overemphasize system flows and underemphasize stocks. Economists follow the behavior of flows, because that’s where the interesting variations and most rapid changes in systems show up. Economic news reports on the national production (flow) of goods and services, the GNP, rather than the total physical capital (stock) of the nation’s factories and farms and businesses that produce those goods and services. But without seeing how stocks affect their related flows through feedback processes, one cannot understand the dynamics of economic systems or the reasons for their behavior.<br class="calibre2"/>这些基于行为的模型比基于事件的模型更有用，但它们仍然存在基本问题。首先，它们通常过分强调系统流，而忽视股票。经济学家追踪流动的行为，因为那是系统中有趣的变化和最快速的变化出现的地方。经济新闻报道的是商品和服务的国民生产总值，而不是生产这些商品和服务的工厂、农场和企业的全部实物资本(存量)。但是，如果没有看到股票是如何通过反馈过程影响其相关流动的，人们就无法理解经济系统的动力学或其行为的原因。</p><p class="calibre_15">Second, and more seriously, in trying to find statistical links that relate flows to each other, econometricians are searching for something that does not exist. There’s no reason to expect any flow to bear a stable relationship to any other flow. Flows go up and down, on and off, in all sorts of combinations, in response to stocks, not to other flows.<br class="calibre2"/>其次，也是更为严肃的是，在试图找到相互关联的资本流动的统计联系时，计量经济学家正在寻找一些并不存在的东西。没有理由期望任何流动与其他流动有稳定的关系。流量上下波动，断断续续，以各种组合方式，响应股票，而不是其他流量。</p><p class="calibre_15">Let me use a simple example to explain what I mean. Suppose you knew nothing at all about thermostats, but you had a lot of data about past heat flows into and out of the room. You could find an equation telling you how those flows have varied together in the past, because under ordinary circumstances, being governed by the same stock (temperature of the room), they do vary together.<br class="calibre2"/>让我用一个简单的例子来解释我的意思。假设你对恒温器一无所知，但是你有很多关于过去热量进出房间的数据。你可以找到一个方程，告诉你这些流量在过去是如何一起变化的，因为在一般情况下，由相同的股票(房间的温度) ，他们一起变化。</p><p class="calibre_15">Your equation would hold, however, only until something changes in the system’s structure—someone opens a window or improves the insulation, or tunes the furnace, or forgets to order oil. You could predict tomorrow’s room temperature with your equation, as long as the system didn’t change or break down. But if you were asked to make the room warmer, or if the room temperature suddenly started plummeting and you had to fix it, or if you wanted to produce the same room temperature with a lower fuel bill, your behavior-level analysis wouldn’t help you. You would have to dig into the system’s structure.<br class="calibre2"/>然而，只有在系统结构发生变化之前，你的方程才能成立——有人打开了窗户，改进了绝缘体，或者调整了炉子，或者忘记订购石油。你可以用你的方程预测明天的室温，只要系统没有改变或者故障。但是，如果你被要求让房间变暖，或者如果室温突然开始下降，你不得不修复它，或者如果你想生产相同的室温与较低的燃料账单，你的行为水平分析不会帮助你。你必须深入研究这个系统的结构。</p><p class="calibre_15">That’s why behavior-based econometric models are pretty good at predicting the near-term performance of the economy, quite bad at predicting the longer-term performance, and terrible at telling one how to improve the performance of the economy.<br class="calibre2"/>这就是为什么基于行为的经济计量模型在预测经济的近期表现方面做得很好，在预测长期表现方面做得很差，在告诉人们如何改善经济表现方面做得很糟糕。</p><p class="calibre_15">And that’s one reason why systems of all kinds surprise us. We are too fascinated by the events they generate. We pay too little attention to their history. And we are insufficiently skilled at seeing in their history clues to the structures from which behavior and events flow.<br class="calibre2"/>这就是为什么各种系统都让我们惊讶的原因之一。我们对它们产生的事件过于着迷。我们太少关注他们的历史。而且我们也没有足够的技巧在他们的历史中看到行为和事件发生的结构的线索。</p><p class="calibre_22"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Linear Minds in a Nonlinear World</span></span><br class="calibre2"/>非线性世界中的线性思维</p><blockquote class="calibre_24">Linear relationships are easy to think about: the more the merrier. Linear equations are solvable, which makes them suitable for textbooks. Linear systems have an important modular virtue: you can take them apart and put them together again—the pieces add up.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_35">Nonlinear systems generally cannot be solved and cannot be added together. . . . Nonlinearity means that the act of playing the game has a way of changing the rules. . . . That twisted changeability makes nonlinearity hard to calculate, but it also creates rich kinds of behavior that never occur in linear systems.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_18">—James Gleick, author of <span class="italic">Chaos: Making a New Science <sup class="calibre7"><small id="filepos206284" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos478330"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre8">3</span><br class="calibre2"/>3</a></small></sup></span></blockquote><p class="calibre_14">We often are not very skilled in understanding the nature of relationships. A <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="bold">linear relationship </span>between two elements in a system can be drawn on a graph with a straight line. It’s a relationship with constant proportions. If I put 10 pounds of fertilizer on my field, my yield will go up by 2 bushels. If I put on 20 pounds, my yield will go up by 4 bushels. If I put on 30 pounds, I’ll get an increase of 6 bushels. <br class="calibre2"/>在理解人际关系的本质方面，我们往往不是很熟练。一个系统中两个元素之间的线性关系可以用一条直线绘制在一张图上。这是一种比例不变的关系。如果我在田里施10磅肥料，我的产量就会增加2蒲式耳。如果我增加20磅，我的产量将增加4蒲式耳。如果我增加30磅，我将得到6蒲式耳的增长。</p><p class="calibre_15">A <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="bold">nonlinear relationship </span>is one in which the cause does not produce a proportional effect. The relationship between cause and effect can only be drawn with curves or wiggles, not with a straight line. If I put 100 pounds of fertilizer on, my yield will go up by 10 bushels; if I put on 200, my yield will not go up at all; if I put on 300, my yield will go down. Why? I’ve damaged my soil with “too much of a good thing.” <br class="calibre2"/>非线性关系是指原因不产生比例效应的关系。因果关系只能用曲线或摆动来描述，而不能用直线来描述。如果我施100磅肥料，我的产量会增加10蒲式耳; 如果我施200磅肥料，我的产量根本不会增加; 如果我施300磅肥料，我的产量会下降。为什么？我用“好东西太多了”来破坏我的土壤</p><p class="calibre_15">The world is full of nonlinearities.<br class="calibre2"/>这个世界充满了非线性。</p><p class="calibre_15">So the world often surprises our linear-thinking minds. If we’ve learned that a small push produces a small response, we think that twice as big a push will produce twice as big a response. But in a nonlinear system, twice the push could produce one-sixth the response, or the response squared, or no response at all.<br class="calibre2"/>因此，这个世界经常让我们这些线性思维的头脑感到惊讶。如果我们知道一个小的推动会产生一个小的反应，我们会认为两倍大的推动会产生两倍大的反应。但在非线性系统中，两次推力可以产生六分之一的响应，或者响应的平方，或者根本没有响应。</p><p class="calibre_15">Here are some examples of nonlinearities:<br class="calibre2"/>下面是一些非线性的例子:</p><p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre2"/></p><blockquote class="calibre_13">• As the flow of traffic on a highway increases, car speed is affected only slightly over a large range of car density. Eventually, however, small further increases in density produce a rapid drop-off in speed. And when the number of cars on the highway builds up to a certain point, it can result in a traffic jam, and car speed drops to zero.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">• Soil erosion can proceed for a long time without much affect on crop yield—until the topsoil is worn down to the depth of the root zone of the crop. Beyond that point, a little further erosion can cause yields to plummet.</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">• A little tasteful advertising can awaken interest in a product. A lot of blatant advertising can cause disgust for the product.</blockquote><p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre2"/></p><p class="calibre_14">You can see why nonlinearities produce surprises. They foil the reasonable expectation that if a little of some cure did a little good, then a lot of it will do a lot of good—or alternately that if a little destructive action caused only a tolerable amount of harm, then more of that same kind of destruction will cause only a bit more harm. Reasonable expectations like these in a nonlinear world produce classic mistakes.<br class="calibre2"/>你可以看到为什么非线性会产生惊喜。他们挫败了这样一种合理的期望，即如果一点点的治愈方法有一点好处，那么很多方法也会有很多好处——或者，如果一点点的破坏性行为只造成一定程度的伤害，那么更多的同类破坏只会造成更多一点的伤害。在一个非线性的世界里，这样的合理预期会产生典型的错误。</p><p class="calibre_15">Nonlinearities are important not only because they confound our expectations about the relationship between action and response. They are even more important because they <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">change the relative strengths of feedback loops</span>. They can flip a system from one mode of behavior to another. <br class="calibre2"/>非线性非常重要，不仅因为它们混淆了我们对于行为和反应之间关系的预期。它们甚至更重要，因为它们改变了反馈回路的相对强度。它们可以将一个系统从一种行为模式转变为另一种行为模式。</p><p class="calibre_15">Nonlinearities are the chief cause of the shifting dominance that characterizes several of the systems in the zoo—the sudden swing between exponential growth caused by a dominant reinforcing loop, say, and then decline caused by a suddenly dominant balancing loop.<br class="calibre2"/>非线性是动物园中几个系统转移优势的主要原因，这种转移优势的特征是: 指数增长之间的突然摆动，这种摆动是由占优势的强化回路引起的，然后是由突然占优势的平衡回路引起的下降。</p><p class="calibre_15">To take a dramatic example of the effects of nonlinearities, consider the destructive irruptions of the spruce budworm in North American forests.<br class="calibre2"/>为了举一个非线性效应的引人注目的例子，考虑一下北美森林中云杉幼虫的破坏性入侵。</p><p class="calibre_14"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="bold">INTERLUDE</span>

•云杉芽虫、冷杉和杀虫剂</p><p class="calibre_14">Tree ring records show that the spruce budworm has been killing spruce and fir trees periodically in North America for at least 400 years. Until this century, no one much cared. The valuable tree for the lumber industry was the white pine. Spruce and fir were considered “weed species.” Eventually, however, the stands of virgin pine were gone, and the lumber industry turned to spruce and fir. Suddenly the budworm was seen as a serious pest.<br class="calibre2"/>树木年轮记录显示，至少400年来，云杉芽虫一直在北美定期杀死云杉和冷杉树。直到本世纪，才有人关心这个问题。对于木材工业来说，最有价值的树木是白松。云杉和冷杉被认为是“杂草物种”然而，最终，原始松树的林地消失了，木材工业转向了云杉和冷杉。突然之间，这种小虫子被视为一种严重的害虫。</p><p class="calibre_15">So, beginning in the 1950s, northern forests were sprayed with DDT to control the spruce budworm. In spite of the spraying, every year there was a budworm resurgence. Annual sprays were continued through the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, until DDT was banned. Then the sprays were changed to fenitrothion, acephate, Sevin, and methoxychlor.<br class="calibre2"/>因此，从20世纪50年代开始，北方的森林被喷洒 DDT 来控制云杉幼虫。尽管喷洒了农药，但是每年都有一种新的幼虫死灰复燃。在1950年代、1960年代和1970年代，每年都有喷洒，直到滴滴涕被禁止。后来，这种喷雾剂被改为杀螟硫磷、乙酰甲胺磷、七氟乙烷和甲氧氯。</p><p class="calibre_15">Insecticides were no longer thought to be the ultimate answer to the budworm problem, but they were still seen as essential. “Insecticides buy time,” said one forester, “That’s all the forest manager wants; to preserve the trees until the mill is ready for them.”<br class="calibre2"/>杀虫剂不再被认为是解决幼虫问题的最终答案，但它们仍被视为必需品。“杀虫剂可以拖延时间,”一位林务员说，“这就是森林管理者想要的: 保护树木，直到磨坊为它们做好准备。”</p><p class="calibre_15">By 1980, spraying costs were getting unmanageable—the Canadian province of New Brunswick spent $12.5 million on budworm “control” that year. Concerned citizens were objecting to the drenching of the landscape with poisons. And, in spite of the sprays, the budworm was still killing as many as 20 million hectares (50 million acres) of trees per year.<br class="calibre2"/>到了1980年，喷洒成本变得难以控制ーー加拿大新不伦瑞克省在那一年花费了1250万美元用于“控制”幼虫。忧心忡忡的市民们反对用毒药浸泡这片土地。而且，尽管有喷雾，这种小虫仍然每年杀死2000万公顷(5000万英亩)的树木。</p><p class="calibre_15">C. S. Holling of the University of British Columbia and Gordon Baskerville of the University of New Brunswick put together a computer model to get a whole-system look at the budworm problem. They discovered that before the spraying began, the budworm had been barely detectable in most years. It was controlled by a number of predators, including birds, a spider, a parasitic wasp, and several diseases. Every few decades, however, there was a budworm outbreak, lasting from six to ten years. Then the budworm population would subside, eventually to explode again<br class="calibre2"/>不列颠哥伦比亚大学的 c · s · 霍林和新不伦瑞克大学的戈登 · 巴斯克维尔建立了一个计算机模型，用于研究蚯蚓问题的整个系统。他们发现，在喷洒开始之前，在大多数年份里，几乎没有发现过这种虫子。它受到许多捕食者的控制，包括鸟类、蜘蛛、寄生蜂和一些疾病。然而，每隔几十年，就会爆发一次幼虫大爆发，持续六到十年不等。然后，这种虫子的数量逐渐减少，最终再次爆发</p><p class="calibre_15">The budworm preferentially attacks balsam fir, secondarily spruce. Balsam fir is the most competitive tree in the northern forest. Left to its own devices, it would crowd out spruce and birch, and the forest would become a monoculture of nothing but fir. Each budworm outbreak cuts back the fir population, opening the forest for spruce and birch. Eventually fir moves back in.<br class="calibre2"/>幼虫优先攻击香脂冷杉，其次是云杉。香脂冷杉是北方森林中最具竞争力的树种。如果任其自生自灭，它将挤走云杉和桦树，森林将变成只有冷杉的单一种植。每一次幼虫的爆发都会减少冷杉的数量，为云杉和桦树打开森林的大门。最终，冷杉又回来了。</p><p class="calibre_15">As the fir population builds up, the probability of an outbreak increases—<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">nonlinearly</span>. The reproductive potential of the budworm increases more than proportionately to the availability of its favorite food supply. The final trigger is two or three warm, dry springs, perfect for the survival of budworm larvae. (If you’re doing event-level analysis, you will blame the outburst on the warm, dry springs.) <br class="calibre2"/>随着杉木种群数量的增加，爆发的可能性非线性地增加。幼虫的繁殖潜力与其最喜欢的食物供应量成比例地增加。最后一个触发因素是两到三个温暖干燥的泉水，对于幼虫的生存来说是完美的。(如果你在做事件层面的分析，你会把爆发归咎于温暖的干泉</p><p class="calibre_15">The budworm population grows too great for its natural enemies to hold in check—<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">nonlinearly</span>. Over a wide range of conditions, greater budworm populations result in more rapid multiplication of budworm predators. But beyond some point, the predators can multiply no faster. What was a reinforcing relationship—more budworms, faster predator multiplication—becomes a nonrelationship—more budworms, no faster predator multiplication—and the budworms take off, unimpeded. <br class="calibre2"/>蚯蚓的数量增长太快，以至于它的天敌无法控制——非线性的。在各种各样的条件下，大量的幼虫数量会导致幼虫捕食者的快速繁殖。但是超过某一点，捕食者的繁殖速度就不会更快了。一种强化关系——更多的幼虫，更快的捕食者增殖——变成了一种非关系——更多的幼虫，没有更快的捕食者增殖——幼虫不受阻碍地起飞。</p><p class="calibre_15">Now only one thing can stop the outbreak: the insect reducing its own food supply by killing off fir trees. When that finally happens, the budworm population crashes—<span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">nonlinearly</span>. The reinforcing loop of budworm reproduction yields dominance to the balancing loop of budworm starvation. Spruce and birch move into the spaces where the firs used to be, and the cycle begins again. <br class="calibre2"/>现在只有一件事可以阻止这种疾病的爆发: 这种昆虫通过杀死冷杉树来减少自己的食物供应。当这种情况最终发生时，幼虫的数量就会非线性地减少。幼虫繁殖的强化循环让位于幼虫饥饿的平衡循环。云杉和桦树迁移到冷杉曾经生长的地方，循环再次开始。</p><p class="calibre_15">The budworm/spruce/fir system oscillates over decades, but it is ecologically stable within bounds. It can go on forever. The main effect of the budworm is to allow tree species other than fir to persist. But in this case what is ecologically stable is economically unstable. In eastern Canada, the economy is almost completely dependent on the logging industry, which is dependent on a steady supply of fir and spruce.<br class="calibre2"/>杨虫/云杉/冷杉系统振荡了几十年，但它在一定范围内是生态稳定的。它可以永远持续下去。芽虫的主要作用是让杉木以外的树种得以延续。但在这种情况下，生态稳定的东西在经济上是不稳定的。在加拿大东部，经济几乎完全依赖于伐木业，而伐木业依赖于稳定的冷杉和云杉供应。</p><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="bold">Many relationships in systems are nonlinear. </span>Their relative strengths shift in disproportionate amounts as the stocks in the system shift. Nonlinearities in feedback systems produce shifting dominance of loops and many complexities in system behavior. </blockquote><p class="calibre_15">When industry sprays insecticides, it shifts the whole system to balance uneasily on different points within its nonlinear relationships. It kills off not only the pest, but the natural enemies of the pest, thereby weakening the feedback loop that normally keeps the budworms in check. It keeps the density of fir high, moving the budworms up their nonlinear reproduction curve to the point at which they’re perpetually on the edge of population explosion.<br class="calibre2"/>当工业喷洒杀虫剂时，整个系统就会在其非线性关系中的不同点上不安地平衡。它不仅杀死了害虫，而且杀死了害虫的天敌，从而削弱了反馈回路，而正常情况下，反馈回路可以控制住幼虫。它保持了冷杉的高密度，使得幼虫沿着非线性的繁殖曲线向上移动，直到它们永远处于种群爆炸的边缘。</p><p class="calibre_15">The forest management practices have set up what Holling calls “persistent semi-outbreak conditions” over larger and larger areas.

In the long term, the full flow is important and, as the physical economy grows and society’s “ecological footprint” expands, the long term is increasingly coming to be the short term. Landfills fill up with a suddenness that has been surprising for people whose mental models picture garbage as going “away,” into some sort of a cloud. Sources of raw materials—mines, wells, and oil fields—can be exhausted with surprising suddenness too.<br class="calibre2"/>是否考虑从矿山到垃圾场的全部流动是重要的，或者像工业界所说的“从摇篮到坟墓”，取决于谁想知道，为了什么目的，在多长时间内。从长远来看，充分的流动是重要的，随着物质经济的增长和社会的”生态足迹”的扩大，长期越来越成为短期。垃圾填埋场充满了突然性，这对于那些心理模型将垃圾描绘成“消失”的人来说是令人惊讶的。原材料的来源——矿井、油田——也可能因为惊人的突然性而耗尽。</p><p class="calibre_15">With a long enough time horizon, even mines and dumps are not the end of the story. The great geological cycles of the earth keep moving materials around, opening and closing seas, raising up and wearing down mountains. Eons from now, everything put in a dump will end up on the top of a mountain or deep under the sea. New deposits of metals and fuels will form. On planet Earth there are no system “clouds,” no ultimate boundaries. Even real clouds in the sky are part of a hydrological cycle. Everything physical comes from somewhere, everything goes somewhere, everything keeps moving.<br class="calibre2"/>在足够长的时间范围内，即使是矿山和垃圾场也不是故事的结局。地球巨大的地质循环不断地移动物质，打开和关闭海洋，上升和磨损山脉。从现在开始，所有被丢进垃圾堆的东西最终都会被丢到山顶或者深埋在海底。新的金属和燃料沉积物将会形成。在地球上，没有系统的“云”，没有终极的边界。甚至天空中真正的云也是水文循环的一部分。一切物质都来自某个地方，一切都去了某个地方，一切都在继续运动。</p><p class="calibre_15">Which is not to say that every model, mental or computer, has to follow each connection until it includes the whole planet. Clouds are a necessary part of models that describe metaphysical flows. Anger literally “comes out of a cloud,” as does love, hatred, self esteem, and so on. If we’re to understand anything, we have to simplify, which means we have to make boundaries. Often that’s a safe thing to do.

Insight comes not only from recognizing which factor is limiting, but from seeing that <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">growth itself depletes or enhances limits </span>and therefore changes what is limiting. The interplay between a growing plant and the soil, a growing company and its market, a growing economy and its resource base, is dynamic. Whenever one factor ceases to be limiting, growth occurs, and the growth itself changes the relative scarcity of factors until another becomes limiting. To shift attention from the abundant factors to the next potential limiting factor is to gain real understanding of, and control over, the growth process. <br class="calibre2"/>每一种生长的植物、儿童、流行病、新产品、技术进步、公司、城市、经济和人口都有层层的限制。洞察力不仅来自于认识到哪些因素是限制性的，还来自于看到生长本身消耗或增强了限制，因此改变了什么是限制性的。生长中的植物和土壤、生长中的公司和它的市场、生长中的经济和它的资源基础之间的相互作用是动态的。每当一个因素不再受到限制，生长就会发生，而生长本身就会改变相对稀缺的因素，直到另一个因素变得受到限制。把注意力从丰富的因素转移到下一个潜在的限制因素，就是获得对成长过程的真正理解和控制。</p><p class="calibre_15">Any physical entity with multiple inputs and outputs—a population, a production process, an economy—is surrounded by layers of limits.

For any physical entity in a finite environment, perpetual growth is impossible. Ultimately, the choice is not to grow forever but to decide what limits to live within. If a company produces a perfect product or service at an affordable price, it will be swamped with orders until it grows to the point at which some limit decreases the perfection of the product or raises its price.

Changing the length of a delay may utterly change behavior. Delays are often sensitive leverage points for policy, if they can be made shorter or longer. You can see why that is. If a decision point in a system (or a person working in that part of the system) is responding to delayed information, or responding with a delay, the decisions will be off target. Actions will be too much or too little to achieve the decision maker’s goals. On the other hand, if action is taken too fast, it may nervously amplify short-term variation and create unnecessary instability. Delays determine how fast systems can react, how accurately they hit their targets, and how timely is the information passed around a system. Overshoots, oscillations, and collapses are always caused by delays.<br class="calibre2"/>系统动物园已经展示了反馈延迟对系统行为的重要性。改变延迟的长度可能会彻底改变行为。延迟通常是政策的敏感杠杆点，如果可以缩短或延长的话。你可以理解为什么会这样。如果系统中的某个决策点(或在该部分系统中工作的人员)对延迟的信息作出响应，或者对延迟作出响应，那么这些决策将偏离目标。行动太多或太少都无法实现决策者的目标。另一方面，如果行动进行得太快，可能会紧张地放大短期变化，造成不必要的不稳定。延迟决定了系统的反应速度，他们达到目标的准确性，以及信息在系统中传递的及时性。延迟总是会导致超调、振荡和崩溃。</p><p class="calibre_15">Understanding delays helps one understand why Mikhail Gorbachev could transform the information system of the Soviet Union virtually overnight, but not the physical economy.

As the household uses more electricity, the wheel turns faster and a dial adds up the accumulated kilowatt-hours.<br class="calibre2"/>这种电表有一个玻璃泡，里面有一个水平的小金属轮子。随着家庭用电量的增加，转盘转得越来越快，一个刻度盘就可以累积千瓦小时。</p><p class="calibre_15">During the oil embargo and energy crisis of the early 1970s, the Dutch began to pay close attention to their energy use. It was discovered that some of the houses in this subdivision used one-third less electricity than the other houses. No one could explain this. All houses were charged the same price for electricity, all contained similar families.<br class="calibre2"/>在20世纪70年代早期的石油禁运和能源危机期间，荷兰人开始密切关注他们的能源使用。人们发现，这个小区的一些住宅用电量比其他住宅少三分之一。没有人能解释这一点。所有的房子都收取同样的电费，所有的房子都有相似的家庭。</p><p class="calibre_15">The difference, it turned out, was in the position of the electric meter. The families with high electricity use were the ones with the meter in the basement, where people rarely saw it. The ones with low use had the meter in the front hall where people passed, the little wheel turning around, adding up the monthly electricity bill many times a day.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7"><small id="filepos252088" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos481152"><span class="calibre8">13</span></a></small></sup>
<br class="calibre2"/>事实证明，差别在于电表的位置。用电量高的家庭是那些把电表放在地下室的家庭，人们很少在那里看到电表。使用率低的那些在人们经过的前厅有计价器，小轮子转动，每天多次累计月电费。13

The right feedback gets to the right place at the right time. Under ordinary circumstances, your liver gets just the information it needs to do its job. In undisturbed ecosystems and traditional cultures, the average individual, species, or population, left to its own devices, behaves in ways that serve and stabilize the whole. These systems and others are self-regulatory. They do not cause problems. We don’t have government agencies and dozens of failed policies about them.<br class="calibre2"/>尽管存在有限理性，一些系统仍然能够很好地运行。正确的反馈在正确的时间到达正确的地点。在一般情况下，你的肝脏得到的信息正是它工作所需要的。在未受干扰的生态系统和传统文化中，个体、物种或种群的平均行为方式是服务和稳定整体的。这些系统和其他系统都是自我调节的。它们不会引起问题。我们没有政府机构，也没有很多失败的政策。</p><p class="calibre_15">Since Adam Smith, it has been widely believed that the free, competitive market is one of these properly structured self-regulating systems. In some ways, it is. In other ways, obvious to anyone who is willing to look, it isn’t. A free market does allow producers and consumers, who have the best information about production opportunities and consumption choices, to make fairly uninhibited and locally rational decisions. But those decisions can’t, by themselves, correct the overall system’s tendency to create monopolies and undesirable side effects (externalities), to discriminate against the poor, or to overshoot its sustainable carrying capacity.<br class="calibre2"/>自亚当•斯密(Adam Smith)以来，人们普遍认为，自由竞争的市场是结构合理的自我调节系统之一。在某些方面，的确如此。在其他方面，对任何愿意看的人来说都是显而易见的，事实并非如此。自由市场确实允许生产者和消费者——他们对生产机会和消费选择有最好的了解——做出相当不受约束的和当地理性的决定。但这些决定本身并不能纠正整个体系产生垄断和不良副作用(外部性)、歧视穷人或超出其可持续承载能力的倾向。</p><p class="calibre_15">To paraphrase a common prayer: God grant us the serenity to exercise our bounded rationality freely in the systems that are structured appropriately, the courage to restructure the systems that aren’t, and the wisdom to know the difference!<br class="calibre2"/>套用一个常见的祷告: 上帝赐予我们宁静，让我们在结构合理的系统中自由地运用我们的有限理性，赐予我们勇气去重建结构不合理的系统，赐予我们智慧去分辨其中的不同！</p><p class="calibre_15">The bounded rationality of each actor in a system—determined by the information, incentives, disincentives, goals, stresses, and constraints impinging on that actor—may or may not lead to decisions that further the welfare of the system as a whole. If they do not, putting new actors into the same system will not improve the system’s performance. What makes a difference is redesigning the system to improve the information, incentives, disincentives, goals, stresses, and constraints that have an effect on specific actors.<br class="calibre2"/>一个系统中每个参与者的有限理性——由影响该参与者的信息、激励、抑制、目标、压力和约束所决定——可能导致也可能不导致进一步促进整个系统福利的决策。如果不是这样，那么将新的参与者放入同一个系统将不会改善系统的性能。有意义的是重新设计系统，以改进对特定参与者产生影响的信息、激励、抑制、目标、压力和约束。</p><blockquote class="calibre_13"><span class="bold">The bounded rationality of each actor in a system may not lead to decisions that further the welfare of the system as a whole.</span></blockquote><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_15"></div>
