They are likely to assume that here, in systems analysis, in interconnection and complication, in the power of the computer, here at last, is the key to prediction and control. This mistake is likely because the mind-set of the industrial world assumes that there is a key to prediction and control.<br class="calibre2"/>那些在工业世界长大、对系统思维充满热情的人很可能会犯一个可怕的错误。他们可能会认为，在这里，在系统分析中，在互联和复杂性中，在计算机的力量中，在这里，最后，是预测和控制的关键。这个错误很可能是因为工业世界的思维模式认为有一个预测和控制的关键。</p><p class="calibre_15">I assumed that at first too. We all assumed it, as eager systems students at the great institution called MIT. More or less innocently, enchanted by what we could see through our new lens, we did what many discoverers do. We exaggerated our findings. We did so not with any intent to deceive others, but in the expression of our own expectations and hopes. Systems thinking for us was more than subtle, complicated mind play. It was going to <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">make systems work</span>. <br class="calibre2"/>我一开始也这么认为。我们都这么认为，因为我们都是麻省理工学院的系统学生。或多或少的天真，被我们通过新的镜头看到的东西所迷惑，我们做了许多发现者做的事情。我们夸大了我们的发现。我们这样做并不是为了欺骗他人，而是为了表达我们自己的期望和希望。对我们来说，系统思维不仅仅是微妙而复杂的思维游戏。它会让系统运转起来。</p><p class="calibre_15">Like the explorers searching for the passage to India who ran into the Western Hemisphere instead, we had found something, but it wasn’t what we thought we had found. It was something so different from what we had been looking for that we didn’t know what to make of it. As we got to know systems thinking better, it turned out to have greater worth than we had thought, but not in the way we had thought.<br class="calibre2"/>就像那些寻找印度之路的探险家们跑到了西半球一样，我们发现了一些东西，但并不是我们所认为的那样。它与我们一直在寻找的东西如此不同，以至于我们不知道该如何解释它。当我们更好地了解系统思考时，它比我们想象的更有价值，但不是以我们想象的方式。</p><p class="calibre_15">Our first comeuppance came as we learned that it’s one thing to under stand how to fix a system and quite another to wade in and fix it. We had many earnest discussions on the topic of “implementation,” by which we meant “how to get managers and mayors and agency heads to follow our advice.”<br class="calibre2"/>我们的第一次报应来自于我们学会了理解如何修复一个系统是一回事，而涉足并修复它则完全是另一回事。我们就“实施”这个话题进行了许多认真的讨论，我们的意思是“如何让经理、市长和机构负责人听从我们的建议”</p><p class="calibre_15"> The truth was, <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">we </span>didn’t even follow our advice. We gave learned lectures on the structure of addiction and could not give up coffee. We knew all about the dynamics of eroding goals and eroded our own jogging programs. We warned against the traps of escalation and shifting the burden and then created them in our own marriages. <br class="calibre2"/>事实是，我们甚至没有听从我们的建议。我们就成瘾的结构进行了博学的演讲，并且不能放弃咖啡。我们知道所有侵蚀目标和侵蚀我们自己慢跑计划的动力学。我们提醒自己注意升级和转移负担的陷阱，然后在我们自己的婚姻中制造了这些陷阱。</p><p class="calibre_15">Social systems are the external manifestations of cultural thinking patterns and of profound human needs, emotions, strengths, and weaknesses. Changing them is not as simple as saying “now all change,” or of trusting that he who knows the good shall do the good.<br class="calibre2"/>社会系统是文化思维模式和深刻的人类需求、情感、优势和弱点的外在表现。改变它们并不像说“现在一切都改变了”那么简单，也不像相信知道好事的人一定会做好事那么简单。</p><p class="calibre_15">We ran into another problem. Our systems insights helped us understand many things we hadn’t understood before, but they didn’t help us understand <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">everything</span>. In fact, they raised at least as many questions as they answered. Like all the other lenses humanity has developed with which to peer into macrocosms and microcosms, this one too revealed wondrous new things, many of which were wondrous new mysteries. The mysteries our new tool revealed lay especially within the human mind and heart and soul. Here are just few of the questions that were prompted by our insights into how systems work. <br class="calibre2"/>我们遇到了另一个问题。我们的系统洞察力帮助我们理解了许多我们以前没有理解的东西，但它们并不能帮助我们理解所有的东西。事实上，他们提出的问题和回答的一样多。就像人类已经发展出来的窥探宏观宇宙和微观宇宙的所有其他镜头一样，这个镜头也揭示了奇妙的新事物，其中许多都是奇妙的新奥秘。我们的新工具所揭示的奥秘，特别是在人类的思想、心灵和灵魂中。以下是我们对系统工作原理的深入了解所提出的几个问题。</p><p class="calibre_15">A systems insight . . . can raise more questions!<br class="calibre2"/>系统洞察力... ... 可以提出更多的问题！</p><p class="calibre_15">Systems thinkers are by no means the first or only people to ask questions like these. When we started asking them, we found whole disciplines, libraries, histories, asking the same questions, and to some extent offering answers. What was unique about our search was not our answers, or even our questions, but the fact that the tool of systems thinking, born out of engineering and mathematics, implemented in computers, drawn from a mechanistic mind-set and a quest for prediction and control, leads its practitioners, inexorably I believe, to confront the most deeply human mysteries. Systems thinking makes clear even to the most committed technocrat that getting along in this world of complex systems requires more than technocracy.<br class="calibre2"/>系统思考者绝不是第一个或者唯一一个提出这样问题的人。当我们开始问他们的时候，我们发现整个学科、图书馆、历史都在问同样的问题，并且在某种程度上提供了答案。我们的研究的独特之处并不在于我们的答案，甚至也不在于我们的问题，而在于这样一个事实: 系统思维的工具，源于工程学和数学，在计算机中实现，源于机械的思维模式，以及对预测和控制的追求，我相信，它的实践者会无情地面对人类最深层次的奥秘。系统思维甚至让最坚定的技术官僚也明白，在这个复杂系统的世界中生存，需要的不仅仅是技术官僚。</p><p class="calibre_15">Self-organizing, nonlinear, feedback systems are inherently unpredictable. They are not controllable. They are understandable only in the most general way. The goal of foreseeing the future exactly and preparing for it perfectly is unrealizable. The idea of making a complex system do just what you want it to do can be achieved only temporarily, at best. We can never fully understand our world, not in the way our reductionist science has led us to expect. Our science itself, from quantum theory to the mathematics of chaos, leads us into irreducible uncertainty. For any objective other than the most trivial, we can’t optimize; we don’t even know what to optimize. We can’t keep track of everything. We can’t find a proper, sustainable relationship to nature, each other, or the institutions we create, if we try to do it from the role of omniscient conqueror.<br class="calibre2"/>自组织、非线性、反馈系统本质上是不可预测的。它们是不可控的。只有在最普遍的情况下，它们才是可以理解的。准确预见未来并为之做好充分准备的目标是不可能实现的。让一个复杂的系统做你想让它做的事情，这个想法最多只能暂时实现。我们永远不可能完全理解我们的世界，不可能像我们的还原论科学所期待的那样。我们的科学本身，从量子理论到混沌的数学，把我们带入了不可还原的不确定性。对于除了最微不足道的事情以外的任何事情，我们都不能优化; 我们甚至不知道优化什么。我们无法跟踪所有事情。如果我们试图从全知的征服者的角色出发，我们就无法找到与自然、彼此或我们创造的机构之间适当的、可持续的关系。</p><p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre2"/></p><table border="0" valign="top" class="calibre10"><tr valign="top" class="calibre11"><td class="calibre12"><span class="calibre6">A new information feedback loop at </span><span class="calibre6"><span class="italic">this </span></span><span class="calibre6">point in this system will make it behave much better.

If you can’t understand, predict, and control, what is there to do?<br class="calibre2"/>对于那些把自己的身份押在无所不知的征服者身上的人来说，系统思维所暴露出来的不确定性是很难接受的。如果你不能理解、预测和控制，那么还有什么可做的呢？</p><p class="calibre_15">Systems thinking leads to another conclusion, however, waiting, shining, obvious, as soon as we stop being blinded by the illusion of control. It says that there is plenty to do, of a different sort of “doing.” The future can’t be predicted, but it can be envisioned and brought lovingly into being. Systems can’t be controlled, but they can be designed and redesigned. We can’t surge forward with certainty into a world of no surprises, but we can expect surprises and learn from them and even profit from them. We can’t impose our will on a system. We can listen to what the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our will alone.<br class="calibre2"/>系统思维导致另一个结论，然而，等待，闪耀，显而易见，只要我们停止被控制的错觉所蒙蔽。它说还有很多事情要做，还有一种不同的“做”未来是无法预测的，但是它可以被设想并且充满爱意地实现。系统无法被控制，但是它们可以被设计和重新设计。我们不可能在一个没有惊喜的世界里确定无疑地前进，但是我们可以期待惊喜，从中学习，甚至从中获利。我们不能把自己的意志强加于一个系统。我们可以倾听系统告诉我们什么，并发现它的属性和我们的价值观如何能够一起工作，带来比我们单凭意志所能创造的更好的东西。</p><p class="calibre_15">We can’t control systems or figure them out. But we can dance with them!<br class="calibre2"/>我们不能控制系统或弄清楚它们，但我们可以与它们共舞！</p><p class="calibre_15">I already knew that, in a way. I had learned about dancing with great powers from whitewater kayaking, from gardening, from playing music, from skiing. All those endeavors require one to stay wide awake, pay close attention, participate flat out, and respond to feedback. It had never occurred to me that those same requirements might apply to intellectual work, to management, to government, to getting along with people.<br class="calibre2"/>在某种程度上，我已经知道了。我从白浪皮划艇，园艺，音乐，滑雪中学到了舞蹈的强大力量。所有这些努力都需要一个人保持清醒，密切关注，全力参与，并对反馈做出回应。我从来没有想到，这些要求可能同样适用于智力工作，管理，政府，与人相处。</p><p class="calibre_15">But there it was, the message emerging from every computer model we made. Living successfully in a world of systems requires more of us than our ability to calculate. It requires our full humanity—our rationality, our ability to sort out truth from falsehood, our intuition, our compassion, our vision, and our morality.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7"><small id="filepos397583" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos486579"><span class="calibre8">2</span></a></small></sup><br class="calibre2"/>但是，我们制作的每一个计算机模型都传达了这样的信息。成功地生活在一个系统化的世界里，对我们的要求远远超过我们的计算能力。它需要我们充分的人性——我们的理性，我们从谬误中分辨真相的能力，我们的直觉，我们的同情心，我们的远见，以及我们的道德</p><p class="calibre_15">I want to end this chapter and this book by trying to summarize the most general “systems wisdoms” I have absorbed from modeling complex systems and from hanging out with modelers. These are the take-home lessons, the concepts and practices that penetrate the discipline of systems so deeply that one begins, however imperfectly, to practice them not just in one’s profession, but in all of life. They are the behaviorial consequences of a worldview based on the ideas of feedback, nonlinearity, and systems responsible for their own behavior. When that engineering professor at Dartmouth noticed that we systems folks were “different” and wondered why, these, I think, were the differences he noticed.<br class="calibre2"/>在结束这一章和这本书时，我想总结一下我从复杂系统建模和与建模师交流中吸收到的最普遍的“系统智慧”。这些是带回家的课程，这些概念和实践深深地渗透到系统的学科中，以至于一个人开始，不管有多么不完美，不仅仅是在自己的职业中，而是在整个生活中实践它们。它们是基于反馈、非线性思想和系统对自身行为负责的世界观的行为后果。当达特茅斯大学的工程学教授注意到我们这些系统人员是“不同的”，并且想知道为什么，我认为，这些就是他注意到的差异。</p><p class="calibre_15">The list probably isn’t complete, because I am still a student in the school of systems. And it isn’t a list that is unique to systems thinking; there are many ways to learn to dance. But here, as a start-off dancing lesson, are the practices I see my colleagues adopting, consciously or unconsciously, as they encounter new systems.<br class="calibre2"/>名单可能不完整，因为我还是系统学院的学生。这并不是一个系统思维独有的清单; 学习跳舞的方法有很多种。但是这里，作为一个开始的舞蹈课程，我看到我的同事们在遇到新的系统时，有意识或无意识地采用了这些练习。</p><p class="calibre_22"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Get the Beat of the System</span></span><br class="calibre2"/>跟上系统的节奏</p><p class="calibre_23">Before you disturb the system in any way, watch how it behaves. If it’s a piece of music or a whitewater rapid or a fluctuation in a commodity price, study its beat. If it’s a social system, watch it work. Learn its history. Ask people who’ve been around a long time to tell you what has happened. If possible, find or make a time graph of actual data from the system—peoples’ memories are not always reliable when it comes to timing.<br class="calibre2"/>在以任何方式扰乱系统之前，先观察它的行为。如果它是一段音乐，或者是急流，或者是商品价格的波动，研究它的节奏。如果它是一个社会系统，观察它的工作原理。了解它的历史。问问那些在你身边很长时间的人，告诉你发生了什么。如果可能的话，找到或者制作一个系统中实际数据的时间图——人们的记忆在时间上并不总是可靠的。</p><p class="calibre_15">This guideline is deceptively simple. Until you make it a practice, you won’t believe how many wrong turns it helps you avoid. Starting with the behavior of the system forces you to focus on facts, not theories. It keeps you from falling too quickly into your own beliefs or misconceptions, or those of others.<br class="calibre2"/>这个指导原则看起来很简单。直到你将它付诸实践，你才会相信它帮助你避免了多少错误的转弯。从系统的行为开始，强迫你关注事实，而不是理论。它可以防止你过快地陷入自己或他人的信仰或误解中。</p><p class="calibre_15">It’s amazing how many misconceptions there can be. People will swear that rainfall is decreasing, say, but when you look at the data, you find that what is really happening is that variability is increasing—the droughts are deeper, but the floods are greater too. I have been told with great authority that the price of milk was going up when it was going down, that real interest rates were falling when they were rising, that the deficit was a higher fraction of the GNP than ever before when it wasn’t.<br class="calibre2"/>令人惊讶的是，世界上有那么多的误解。比如说，人们会发誓说降雨量在减少，但是当你看数据时，你会发现真正发生的是变化性在增加——干旱更严重，但是洪水也更严重。有人非常权威地告诉我，牛奶价格下跌时上涨，实际利率上升时下降，赤字占国民生产总值的比例比以往任何时候都高。</p><p class="calibre_15">It’s especially interesting to watch how the various elements in the system do or do not vary together. Watching what really happens, instead of listening to peoples’ theories of what happens, can explode many careless causal hypotheses. Every selectman in the state of New Hampshire seems to be positive that growth in a town will lower taxes, but if you plot growth rates against tax rates, you find a scatter as random as the stars in a New Hampshire winter sky. There is no discernible relationship at all.<br class="calibre2"/>尤其有趣的是，我们可以观察系统中的各种因素是如何一起变化的。观察到底发生了什么，而不是听取人们关于发生了什么的理论，可以打破许多粗心的因果假设。新罕布什尔州的每一位行政委员似乎都乐观地认为，一个城镇的经济增长将降低税收，但如果你将增长率与税率进行比较，你会发现，这种分布就像新罕布什尔州冬天天空中的星星一样随机。两者之间根本没有明显的关系。</p><p class="calibre_15">Starting with the behavior of the system directs one’s thoughts to dynamic, not static, analysis—not only to “What’s wrong?” but also to “How did we get there?” “What other behavior modes are possible?” “If we don’t change direction, where are we going to end up?” And looking to the strengths of the system, one can ask “What’s working well here?” Starting with the history of several variables plotted together begins to suggest not only what elements are in the system, but how they might be interconnected.<br class="calibre2"/>从系统的行为开始，将一个人的思想引向动态的，而不是静态的分析，而不仅仅是“怎么了?”还有“我们是怎么做到的?”“还有其他可能的行为模式吗?”“如果我们不改变方向，最后会怎么样?”看看这个系统的优势，你可能会问: “这个系统运行得怎么样?”从绘制在一起的几个变量的历史开始，我们不仅可以知道系统中的元素是什么，而且可以知道它们是如何相互联系的。</p><p class="calibre_15">And finally, starting with history discourages the common and distracting tendency we all have to define a problem not by the system’s actual behavior, but by the lack of our favorite solution. (The problem is, we need to find more oil. The problem is, we need to ban abortion. The problem is, we don’t have enough salesmen. The problem is, how can we attract more growth to this town?) Listen to any discussion, in your family or a committee meeting at work or among the pundits in the media, and watch people leap to solutions, usually solutions in “predict, control, or impose your will” mode, without having paid any attention to what the system is doing and why it’s doing it.<br class="calibre2"/>最后，从历史的角度出发，不鼓励我们通常不得不用系统的实际行为，而是缺乏我们喜欢的解决方案来定义一个问题的共同和分散注意力的倾向。(问题是，我们需要找到更多的石油。问题是，我们需要禁止堕胎。问题是，我们没有足够的销售人员。问题是，我们怎样才能吸引更多的增长到这个城市倾听任何讨论，无论是在你的家庭中，还是在工作中的委员会会议上，抑或是在媒体中的权威人士之间，看着人们跳跃到解决方案，通常是在“预测、控制或强加你的意志”的模式下，而不去关注系统在做什么以及它为什么这样做。</p><p class="calibre_22"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Expose Your Mental Models to the Light of Day</span></span><br class="calibre2"/>把你的心理模型暴露在阳光下</p><p class="calibre_23">When we draw structural diagrams and then write equations, we are forced to make our assumptions visible and to express them with rigor. We have to put every one of our assumptions about the system out where others (and we ourselves) can see them. Our models have to be complete, and they have to add up, and they have to be consistent. Our assumptions can no longer slide around (mental models are very slippery), assuming one thing for purposes of one discussion and something else contradictory for purposes of the next discussion.<br class="calibre2"/>当我们画结构图，然后写方程式，我们被迫使我们的假设可见，并表达它们的严格性。我们必须把我们对系统的每一个假设都放在别人(包括我们自己)可以看到的地方。我们的模型必须是完整的，它们必须加起来，它们必须是一致的。我们的假设再也不能滑动(心智模型是非常狡猾的) ，假设一件事情是为了一个讨论的目的，而另一件事情是为了下一个讨论的目的而矛盾的。</p><p class="calibre_15">You don’t have to put forth your mental model with diagrams and equations, although doing so is a good practice. You can do it with words or lists or pictures or arrows showing what you think is connected to what. The more you do that, in any form, the clearer your thinking will become, the faster you will admit your uncertainties and correct your mistakes, and the more flexible you will learn to be. Mental flexibility—the willingness to redraw boundaries, to notice that a system has shifted into a new mode, to see how to redesign structure—is a necessity when you live in a world of flexible systems.<br class="calibre2"/>你不必用图表和方程式建立你的心理模型，尽管这样做是一个很好的实践。你可以用文字、列表、图片或者箭头来表明你认为什么与什么相关。无论以何种形式，你这样做的次数越多，你的思维就会变得越清晰，你就会越快地承认你的不确定性并纠正你的错误，你就会学会变得越灵活。当你生活在一个充满灵活系统的世界里时，心理灵活性——愿意重新划定界限，注意到一个系统已经转变成一种新的模式，看看如何重新设计结构——是必不可少的。</p><p class="calibre_15">Remember, always, that everything you know, and everything everyone knows, is only a model. Get your model out there where it can be viewed. Invite others to challenge your assumptions and add their own. Instead of becoming a champion for one possible explanation or hypothesis or model, collect as many as possible. Consider all of them to be plausible until you find some evidence that causes you to rule one out. That way you will be emotionally able to see the evidence that rules out an assumption that may become entangled with your own identity.<br class="calibre2"/>永远记住，你所知道的一切，每个人所知道的一切，都只是一个模型。把你的模型放在可以看到的地方。邀请其他人挑战你的假设，并添加他们自己的假设。与其成为一个可能的解释、假设或模型的拥护者，不如尽可能多地收集。考虑所有这些都是合理的，直到你找到一些证据，使你排除其中一个。这样你就能在情感上看到证据，排除一个可能与你自己的身份纠缠在一起的假设。</p><p class="calibre_15">Getting models out into the light of day, making them as rigorous as possible, testing them against the evidence, and being willing to scuttle them if they are no longer supported is nothing more than practicing the scientific method—something that is done too seldom even in science, and is done hardly at all in social science or management or government or everyday life.<br class="calibre2"/>让模型公之于众，让它们尽可能严谨，对证据进行检验，如果它们不再得到支持，就愿意放弃它们，这无非是在实践科学方法——即使在科学领域也很少做到这一点，在社会科学、管理、政府或日常生活中也很少做到这一点。</p><p class="calibre_22"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Honor, Respect, and Distribute Information</span></span><br class="calibre2"/>荣誉、尊重和传播信息</p><p class="calibre_23">You’ve seen how information holds systems together and how delayed, biased, scattered, or missing information can make feedback loops malfunction. Decision makers can’t respond to information they don’t have, can’t respond accurately to information that is inaccurate, and can’t respond in a timely way to information that is late. I would guess that most of what goes wrong in systems goes wrong because of biased, late, or missing information.<br class="calibre2"/>您已经看到了信息如何将系统维系在一起，以及延迟、偏见、分散或缺失的信息如何导致反馈回路故障。决策者不能对他们没有的信息作出反应，不能对不准确的信息作出准确的反应，也不能对迟到的信息作出及时的反应。我猜测，系统中出现的大部分问题都是由于偏见、延迟或缺失信息造成的。</p><p class="calibre_15">If I could, I would add an eleventh commandment to the first ten: <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">Thou shalt not distort, delay, or withhold information</span>.

Through the Freedom of Information Act (from a systems point of view, one of the most important laws in the nation), that information became a matter of public record. In July 1988, the first data on chemical emissions became available. The reported emissions were not illegal, but they didn’t look very good when they were published in local papers by enterprising reporters, who had a tendency to make lists of “the top ten local polluters.” That’s all that happened. There were no lawsuits, no required reductions, no fines, no penalties. But within two years chemical emissions nationwide (at least as reported, and presumably also in fact) had decreased by 40 percent. Some companies were launching policies to bring their emissions down by 90 percent, just because of the release of previously withheld information.<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7"><small id="filepos406410" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos486905"><span class="calibre8">3</span></a></small></sup>

But it also required monitoring the situation and reconvening an international congress to change the phase-out schedule, if the damage to the ozone layer turned out to be more or less than expected.

It means what psychologist Don Michael calls “error-embracing.” It takes a lot of courage to embrace your errors.<br class="calibre2"/>这很难。这意味着犯错误，更糟糕的是，承认错误。这就是心理学家唐 · 迈克尔所说的“拥抱错误”拥抱你的错误需要很大的勇气。</p><blockquote class="calibre_13">Neither we ourselves, nor our associates, nor the publics that need to be involved . . . can learn what is going on and might go on if we act as if we really had the facts, were really certain about all the issues, knew exactly what the outcomes should/ could be, and were really certain that we were attaining the most preferred outcomes. Moreover, when addressing complex social issues, acting as if we knew what we were doing simply decreases our credibility. . . . Distrust of institutions and authority figures is increasing. The very act of acknowledging uncertainty could help greatly to reverse this worsening trend.<sup class="calibre7"><small id="filepos425471" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos487760"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre8">8</span><br class="calibre2"/>8</a></small></sup>
</blockquote><blockquote class="calibre_13">Error-embracing is the condition for learning. It means seeking and using—and sharing—information about what went wrong with what you expected or hoped would go right. Both error embracing and living with high levels of uncertainty emphasize our personal as well as societal vulnerability. Typically we hide our vulnerabilities from ourselves as well as from others. But . . . to be the kind of person who truly accepts his responsibility . . . requires knowledge of and access to self far beyond that possessed by most people in this society.<sup class="calibre7"><small id="filepos426144" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos487963"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre8">9</span><br class="calibre2"/>9</a></small></sup></blockquote><p class="calibre_22"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Celebrate Complexity</span></span><br class="calibre2"/>庆祝复杂性</p><p class="calibre_23">Let’s face it, the universe is messy. It is nonlinear, turbulent, and dynamic. It spends its time in transient behavior on its way to somewhere else, not in mathematically neat equilibria. It self-organizes and evolves. It creates diversity <span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="italic">and </span>uniformity. That’s what makes the world interesting, that’s what makes it beautiful, and that’s what makes it work. <br class="calibre2"/>让我们面对现实吧，宇宙是混乱的。它是非线性的，动荡的，动态的。它把时间花费在通往其他地方的短暂行为上，而不是在数学上的整齐平衡中。它自我组织和进化。它创造了多样性和统一性。正是这些让世界变得有趣，让世界变得美丽，让世界运转起来。</p><p class="calibre_15">There’s something within the human mind that is attracted to straight lines and not curves, to whole numbers and not fractions, to uniformity and not diversity, and to certainties and not mystery. But there is something else within us that has the opposite set of tendencies, since we ourselves evolved out of and are shaped by and structured as complex feedback systems. Only a part of us, a part that has emerged recently, designs buildings as boxes with uncompromising straight lines and flat surfaces. Another part of us recognizes instinctively that nature designs in fractals, with intriguing detail on every scale from the microscopic to the macroscopic. That part of us makes Gothic cathedrals and Persian carpets, symphonies and novels, Mardi Gras costumes and artificial intelligence programs, all with embellishments almost as complex as the ones we find in the world around us.<br class="calibre2"/>在人类的思维中，有些东西被直线而不是曲线所吸引，被整数而不是分数所吸引，被一致性而不是多样性所吸引，被确定性而不是神秘感所吸引。但是我们内心还有一些东西有着相反的倾向，因为我们自己是从复杂的反馈系统中进化出来的，并且被它们塑造成复杂的结构。只有我们的一部分，最近出现的一部分，将建筑设计成有着不妥协的直线和平坦表面的盒子。我们的另一部分本能地认识到，自然界的设计是以分形的形式进行的，从微观到宏观的每一个尺度上都有着有趣的细节。我们的这一部分使哥特式大教堂和波斯地毯，交响乐和小说，狂欢节服装和人工智能程序，所有的装饰几乎与我们在周围的世界发现的一样复杂。</p><p class="calibre_15">We can, and some of us do, celebrate and encourage self-organization, disorder, variety, and diversity. Some of us even make a moral code of doing so, as Aldo Leopold did with his land ethic: “A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.”<sup xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre7"><small id="filepos428026" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos488168"><span class="calibre8">10</span></a></small></sup><br class="calibre2"/>我们可以，而且我们中的一些人确实可以，庆祝和鼓励自我组织、无序、多样性和多样性。我们中的一些人甚至制定了这样做的道德准则，就像奥尔多 · 利奥波德(Aldo Leopold)对他的土地伦理所做的那样: “当一件事情倾向于保持生物群落的完整性、稳定性和美丽时，它就是正确的。如果不是这样，那就是错误的。”10</p><p class="calibre_22"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre6"><span class="bold">Expand Time Horizons</span></span><br class="calibre2"/>扩展时间视野</p><p class="calibre_97">One of the worst ideas humanity ever had was the interest rate, which led to the further ideas of payback periods and discount rates, all of which provide a rational, quantitative excuse for ignoring the long term.<br class="calibre2"/>人类有史以来最糟糕的想法之一是利率，这导致了更进一步的回收期和贴现率的想法，所有这些都为忽视长期提供了一个合理的、定量的借口。</p><p class="calibre_15">The official time horizon of industrial society doesn’t extend beyond what will happen after the next election or beyond the payback period of current investments. The time horizon of most families still extends farther than that—through the lifetimes of children or grandchildren. Many Native American cultures actively spoke of and considered in their decisions the effects on the seventh generation to come. The longer the operant time horizon, the better the chances for survival. As Kenneth Boulding wrote:<br class="calibre2"/>工业社会的官方时间范围不会超过下次选举后的情况，也不会超过当前投资的回收期。大多数家庭的时间范围仍然远远超过这个范围——通过子女或孙辈的一生。许多美洲土著文化积极地谈论和考虑他们的决定对第七代后代的影响。时间跨度越长，生存的机会就越大。正如肯尼思 · 博尔丁所写:</p><blockquote class="calibre_13">There is a great deal of historical evidence to suggest that a society which loses its identity with posterity and which loses its positive image of the future loses also its capacity to deal with present problems, and soon falls apart. . . . There has always been something rather refreshing in the view that we should live like the birds, and perhaps posterity is for the birds in more senses than one; so perhaps we should all . . . go out and pollute something cheerfully. As an old taker of thought for the morrow, however, I cannot quite accept this solution. . . .<sup class="calibre7"><small id="filepos429603" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos488356"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre8">11</span><br class="calibre2"/>11</a></small></sup></blockquote><p class="calibre_15">In a strict systems sense, there is no long term, short-term distinction. Phenomena at different time-scales are nested within each other. Actions taken now have some immediate effects and some that radiate out for decades to come. We experience now the consequences of actions set in motion yesterday and decades ago and centuries ago. The couplings between very fast processes and very slow ones are sometimes strong, sometimes weak. When the slow ones dominate, nothing seems to be happening; when the fast ones take over, things happen with breathtaking speed. Systems are always coupling and uncoupling the large and the small, the fast and the slow.<br class="calibre2"/>在严格的系统意义上，没有长期的、短期的区别。不同时间尺度的现象彼此嵌套。现在采取的行动有一些立竿见影的效果，也有一些会在未来几十年内辐射出去。我们现在经历着昨天、几十年前和几个世纪前所采取行动的后果。非常快的进程和非常慢的进程之间的耦合有时很强，有时很弱。当慢的占主导地位时，似乎什么也没发生; 当快的占主导地位时，事情发生的速度快得惊人。系统总是耦合和解耦大的和小的，快的和慢的。</p><p class="calibre_15">When you’re walking along a tricky, curving, unknown, surprising, obstacle-strewn path, you’d be a fool to keep your head down and look just at the next step in front of you. You’d be equally a fool just to peer far ahead and never notice what’s immediately under your feet. You need to be watching both the short and the long term—the whole system.<br class="calibre2"/>当你走在一条复杂的、弯曲的、未知的、令人惊讶的、布满障碍的小路上时，如果你低着头看着你面前的下一步，那你就是一个傻瓜。如果你只是盯着远处看，却从来没有注意到你脚下的东西，你同样也是一个傻瓜。你需要同时关注短期和长期——整个系统。</p><p class="calibre_22"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="bold">Defy the Disciplines</span><br class="calibre2"/>违抗纪律</p><p class="calibre_23">In spite of what you majored in, or what the textbooks say, or what you think you’re an expert at, follow a system wherever it leads. It will be sure to lead across traditional disciplinary lines. To understand that system, you will have to be able to learn from—while not being limited by—economists and chemists and psychologists and theologians. You will have to penetrate their jargons, integrate what they tell you, recognize what they can honestly see through their particular lenses, and discard the distortions that come from the narrowness and incompleteness of their lenses. They won’t make it easy for you.<br class="calibre2"/>不管你的专业是什么，或者教科书上怎么说，或者你认为自己是什么方面的专家，都要遵循一个系统，无论它指向哪里。它肯定会跨越传统的学科界限。要理解这个系统，你必须能够从经济学家、化学家、心理学家和神学家那里学习，同时不受他们的限制。你必须深入了解他们的行话，整合他们告诉你的东西，认识到他们通过他们特定的镜头可以真实地看到什么，并且抛弃由于他们镜头的狭窄和不完整而产生的扭曲。他们不会让你这么容易。</p><p class="calibre_15">Seeing systems whole requires more than being “interdisciplinary,” if that word means, as it usually does, putting together people from different disciplines and letting them talk past each other. Interdisciplinary communication works only if there is a real problem to be solved, and if the representatives from the various disciplines are more committed to solving the problem than to being academically correct. They will have to go into learning mode. They will have to admit ignorance and be willing to be taught, by each other and by the system.<br class="calibre2"/>看到整个系统需要的不仅仅是“跨学科”，如果这个词的意思是，像通常一样，把来自不同学科的人聚集在一起，让他们相互交谈。跨学科交流只有在有一个真正的问题需要解决的情况下才能发挥作用，如果来自不同学科的代表更致力于解决问题而不是在学术上保持正确。他们将不得不进入学习模式。他们必须承认自己的无知，并愿意接受教育，接受彼此的教育，接受系统的教育。</p><p class="calibre_15">It can be done. It’s very exciting when it happens.<br class="calibre2"/>这是可以做到的。当它发生的时候，是非常令人兴奋的。</p><p class="calibre_22"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="bold">Expand the Boundary of Caring</span><br class="calibre2"/>扩大关怀的范围</p><p class="calibre_23">Living successfully in a world of complex systems means expanding not only time horizons and thought horizons; above all, it means expanding the horizons of caring. There are moral reasons for doing that, of course. And if moral arguments are not sufficient, then systems thinking provides the practical reasons to back up the moral ones. The real system is interconnected. No part of the human race is separate either from other human beings or from the global ecosystem. It will not be possible in this integrated world for your heart to succeed if your lungs fail, or for your company to succeed if your workers fail, or for the rich in Los Angeles to succeed if the poor in Los Angeles fail, or for Europe to succeed if Africa fails, or for the global economy to succeed if the global environment fails.<br class="calibre2"/>成功地生活在一个复杂系统的世界里，不仅意味着扩展时间视野和思维视野; 最重要的是，它意味着扩展关怀的视野。当然，这样做是有道德原因的。如果道德论证不够充分，那么系统思考就提供了支持道德论证的实际理由。真正的系统是相互关联的。人类的任何一部分都不能与其他人或全球生态系统分开。在这个一体化的世界里，如果你的肺衰竭，你的心脏就不可能成功; 如果你的员工失败，你的公司就不可能成功; 如果洛杉矶的穷人失败，洛杉矶的富人就不可能成功; 如果非洲失败，欧洲就不可能成功; 如果全球环境失败，全球经济就不可能成功。</p><p class="calibre_15">As with everything else about systems, most people already know about the interconnections that make moral and practical rules turn out to be the same rules. They just have to bring themselves to believe that which they know.<br class="calibre2"/>正如其他有关系统的事情一样，大多数人已经知道使道德规则和实际规则变成相同规则的相互联系。他们只需要让自己相信他们所知道的。</p><p class="calibre_22"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="bold">Don’t Erode the Goal of Goodness</span><br class="calibre2"/>不要侵蚀善良的目标</p><p class="calibre_23">The most damaging example of the systems archetype called “drift to low performance” is the process by which modern industrial culture has eroded the goal of morality. The workings of the trap have been classic, and awful to behold.<br class="calibre2"/>被称为“向低绩效漂移”的系统原型的最具破坏性的例子是现代工业文化侵蚀道德目标的过程。这种陷阱的运作方式是经典的，而且看起来很可怕。</p><p class="calibre_15">Examples of bad human behavior are held up, magnified by the media, affirmed by the culture, as typical. This is just what you would expect. After all, we’re only human. The far more numerous examples of human goodness are barely noticed. They are “not news.” They are exceptions. Must have been a saint. Can’t expect everyone to behave like that.<br class="calibre2"/>人类不良行为的例子被媒体高举，被放大，被文化肯定，就像典型的一样。这正是你所期待的。毕竟，我们只是人类。更多的人类善良的例子很少被注意到。他们“不是新闻”他们是例外。一定是个圣人。不能指望每个人都这样。</p><p class="calibre_15">And so expectations are lowered. The gap between desired behavior and actual behavior narrows. Fewer actions are taken to affirm and instill ideals. The public discourse is full of cynicism. Public leaders are visibly, unrepentantly amoral or immoral and are not held to account. Idealism is ridiculed. Statements of moral belief are suspect. It is much easier to talk about hate in public than to talk about love. The literary critic and naturalist Joseph Wood Krutch put it this way:<br class="calibre2"/>因此，人们的期望值降低了。期望行为和实际行为之间的差距缩小了。更少的行动被用来肯定和灌输理想。公共话语充满了愤世嫉俗。公共领导人是明显的，不知悔改的不道德或不道德的，不被追究责任。理想主义被嘲笑。道德信仰的陈述是可疑的。在公共场合谈论仇恨要比谈论爱容易得多。文学评论家和自然主义者约瑟夫 · 伍德 · 克鲁奇这样说:</p><blockquote class="calibre_13">Thus though man has never before been so complacent about what he <span class="italic">has</span>, or so confident of his ability to <span class="italic">do </span>whatever he sets his mind upon, it is at the same time true that he never before accepted so low an estimate of what <span class="italic">he is</span>. That same scientific method which enabled him to create his wealth and to unleash the power he wields has, he believes, enabled biology and psychology to explain him away—or at least to explain away whatever used to seem unique or even in any way mysterious. . . . Truly he is, for all his wealth and power, poor in spirit.<sup class="calibre7"><small id="filepos435227" class="calibre8"><a href="index_split_021.html#filepos488675"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="calibre8">12</span><br class="calibre2"/>12</a></small></sup></blockquote><p class="calibre5"><br class="calibre2"/></p><p class="calibre_14">We know what to do about drift to low performance. Don’t weigh the bad news more heavily than the good. And keep standards absolute.<br class="calibre2"/>我们知道如何处理向低性能漂移的问题。不要把坏消息看得比好消息更重。保持绝对的标准。</p><p class="calibre_15">Systems thinking can only tell us to do that. It can’t do it. We’re back to the gap between understanding and implementation. Systems thinking by itself cannot bridge that gap, but it can lead us to the edge of what analysis can do and then point beyond—to what can and must be done by the human spirit.<br class="calibre2"/>系统思维只能告诉我们这么做。它做不到。我们又回到了理解和实现之间的鸿沟。系统思维本身无法弥合这种差距，但它可以把我们引向分析能够做到的边缘，然后指向更远的方向——人类精神能够而且必须做到的事情。</p><div class="mbp_pagebreak" id="calibre_pb_19"></div>
